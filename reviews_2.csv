Number 16 Restaurant,5,"My husband and I were wowed by our experience at number 16. It was our last meal of our honeymoon, and we wanted a really good dinner. I cannot say enough about this restaurant. The food was exquisite. Everything from the soup to the entrees, to the incredible lemon dessert thing! The service was excellent too! I wish I could remember our servers name. He was super tall with reddish hair. 20 some thing.

I think one of the best references we can give is that we were sitting next to a party who were locals. Will locals as in three hours from the restaurant. They said that they never miss coming to the restaurant every time they‚Äôre in town. The next time we are in Glasgow, we will definitely make it back!"
Number 16 Restaurant,5,"A great find thanks to the Michelin Guide, where Number 16 very much deserves to be. Lovely little place with very friendly staff, really delicious food (the cured sea bass to start was absolutely exceptional). Really glad to have found this place: highly recommend."
Number 16 Restaurant,5,"My partner & I tried 2 starters, 2 mains and 2 desserts from their 3 course set menu. We love everything! From the service to the plating, and esp the careful & well put together pairing of fusion of flavours in each plate was simply divine. Highly recommended :-)"
Number 16 Restaurant,5,"We discovered this wonderful restaurant today. We ate duck leg terrine, cured salmon, venison ragu, pork belly & coconut parfait. Every dish was perfectly balanced and totally delicious. This small, but perfectly formed restaurant, is a must visit! Great service & lovely intimate atmosphere."
Number 16 Restaurant,5,"Out for our anniversary dinner..
We both agreed that this was probably the best food we have had in the Glasgow area.

The food was exceptional and the service matched the food..
Great little restaurant with reasonably priced delicious food.. We will definitely be back.."
Ox and Finch,5,"We ordered 8 dishes in total (3 people) and everything was very well-seasoned and delicious! ü§§
Highly recommend the lamb shoulders, üêë buffalo mozzarella with kale, cod cheek and poached beam üêü
Rump steak was okay ü•© but we loved the sauce
Dessert looked beautiful and tasted surrealü•π
Service was quite quick and the staff were very friendly‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Ox and Finch,5,"We love this place - tapas style, small dish, price is reasonable to share in big groups (do come in big groups so you can try most of the menu - we regretted not having friends in Glasgow to try this). Definitely will come back!

It seemed like they have seasonal menu and change up the dish, so we didn't get the recommended beef caparccio. However, the rest of the menu piqued our interest.

We have:

- Beef tartare (11/10): Presentation was ON POINT! The beef was sweet, umami, the egg yolk was light and airy, croutons added lots of crunchy character and made it so fun in the mouth to eat. The horseradish gave a fresh and refreshing taste. AMAZING!

- Stone bass crudo (7/10): The fish was fresh, chewy, nice + paired well with the sauce. Definitely on the saltier side so we thought it would go well with some white wine. However, we don't like the hazelnut - it wasn't crunchy, the particularly hazelnut taste didn't blend well.

- Spiced haddock (9/10): The spice was amazing + the SAUCE. We licked the dish clean.

- Blood orange and fennel panzanella (9/10): The spice was amazing + the SAUCE. We licked the dish clean.

Even at 4pm, the place still had 4-5 tables so definitely recommend reservations."
Ox and Finch,5,"The perfect dining experience!
This was our second visit to Ox & Finch (the first in pre-Covid times) and it was just as we remembered it; outstanding from start to finish!
Every single dish we ordered was exceptional; you can tell that every dish has been thought through diligently and utilises the best ingredients with outstanding care to detail.  The recommendations from their excellent staff were amazing even though one recommended dish was out of my comfort zone it was perfectly balanced and tasted sublime - so thank you for making the recommendation.
I doubt there is a better restaurant in the UK let alone Glasgow which compares with the experience and food at Ox & Finch - this is not hyperbole on my part, I have dined in everything from casual establishments to Michelin starred restaurants across the world and I, personally, think this is the best restaurant I've ever eaten in - I only wish I lived closer so I could do so more regularly.
The range of dishes allows for any and all palettes to be satisfied, we ordered a number of dishes (some pictured) and they all complemented each other; thanks to the recommendations.
The staff are very attentive without being overbearing and on this particular visit they went above and beyond which was very much unexpected but very much appreciated.  They engage when you wish to and leave you to enjoy in the perfect balance.
I cannot recommend them highly enough, whether a local or on a visit to Glasgow make sure you book in for the perfect dining experience at Ox & Finch."
Ox and Finch,5,"one of the best MICHELIN GUIDE restaurant!

service was the best, explained well on how the food will come (tapas style : out when its cooked) & described the menu well

we ordered :
- fried artichoke (7/10) : mix of salty from the frying oil and sour from the yoghurt
- duck liver parfait (9/10) : very delicious! savoury from the pate combined with the toast & berry jam
- cod cheeks (9/10) : texture‚Äôs nice & a bit chewy just like scallop
- grilled coley (4/10) : too salty for us unfortunately
- slow cooked lamb shoulder (10/10) : MUST TRY! very delicious, lamb was very tender & juicy, combined with the herbs it was like HEAVEN
- pan seared pork fillet (9/10) : delicious & tasty, pork is juicy & succulent
- dry rump steak (9/10) : peppercorn sauce compliments the juicy meat

i recommend u to reserve online before visiting as it gets crowded"
Ox and Finch,5,"Went on a Friday evening. Had a really good time. The food was good and we loved the dishes. Great value for money and good portion sizes.

I recommend the crab tubetti, rump steak, slow cooked lamb and the feta cheese flat bred, absolutely delicious.

Server was friendly. If we are ever back in the city would definitely try again."
Bothy Glasgow,5,"I went here for the Burns night with a friend and it was a spectacular evening, the atmosphere was wonderful, the staff were really good and attentive.

The food was great but not to the standard I would have expected for a higher end restaurant. I loved the haggis, neeps and tatties though the ham hock & lentil soup was just OK. The cranachan cheesecake was quite nice. My friend loved her salmon starter though felt the sticky toffee pudding was a bit heavy. She also thought the haggis was delicious.

The whisky flight was very good value for money considering the price of the bottles, I had the Isles one and would recommend it. We also had a few bottles of red wine, the cheaper ones tasted better than the more expensive bottle.

I'd definitely go back but would try other options on the menu along with another whisky flight üòÄ"
Bothy Glasgow,4,"I feel this is a place that rests on their laurels and could use some rejuvenation. The food mains were good, but somewhat salty on the sides and veg. The service was definitely lacking in promptness. Our mains came out nearly 1.5h after arriving (we had starters)."
Bothy Glasgow,4,"It‚Äôs a lovely restaurant area and the staff are very pleasant. The menu has several vegetarian and vegan üå± options which is great, but I think the quality of those courses is probably a bit below the meat dishes.
Sunday roast is good."
Bothy Glasgow,5,"Really friendly staff, really fancy and tasty food. All arrived quickly. Really nice renovation since was last here. Definitely recommend. Is a little pricey but it‚Äôs definitely worth it as a treat as it reflects in the food and decor."
Bothy Glasgow,5,"This is the first time we have visited for many years after tonight‚Äôs meal I really can‚Äôt understand why we waited so long! Everything was lovely and from my point of view nearly everything was Gluten Free. This is because they create their own sauces and reduce to thicken to enhance the flavour rather than add flour. The menu has game meat on the menu. I had smoked duck starter followed by venison ( see photos). Then my ultimate treat Gluten Free sticky toffee pudding. Our next visit will be soon, no way am I going to leave a long gap like last time üòé"
Gloriosa,4,"We have been many times to Gloriosa and always really enjoyed the food and general atmosphere. We have come with friends or just ourselves and like the mediterranean sharing plates. When we went most recently we got seated beside the front door which kept hitting us with wind and banging. The service was bad - while the small plates came fairly fast, we waited ages for the bigger plates (with no drinks as another wasn‚Äôt offered). We noticed that after the table next to us paid, the girl was waiting for her friend to use the bathroom to leave and she got told she had to move and couldn‚Äôt sit to wait, so she had to stand awkwardly between tables. The food was good but not as amazing as usual. The focaccia is amazing and I liked the eggs and panna cotta. But the clams were full of sand, the cavolo so salty it was inedible so that dish was way too expensive for what it was. The artichokes were ok but not incredible. I hope it was just a one-off but we were disappointed overall. We will definitely try again."
Gloriosa,5,"Our first time here and this is one of the best meals I have had for a while. Delicious, fresh, seasonal and well executed.

There was lots on the menu we wanted to try. We will have to come back to try some more dishes.

Favourites for me were the artichoke and the cacio e pepe. The red cabbage also. Oh and all of the rest üòÖ

It was a little pricy but I think it was worth it."
Gloriosa,5,Superb menu and drinks list: really imaginative. Everything was beautifully cooked. The fish was outstanding and the vegetable dishes very flavoursome. The plates are not really small/sharing plates but are all quite big: 2 per person is more than enough.  Very nice candlelit ambience.
Gloriosa,5,"This is the second time me and my partner have come here. It's a treat for us usually as we like to try many of the dishes and splurge. Its reasonably priced for the quality of the food. The food is delicious, beautiful, local and great recipes that you wouldn't find anywhere else. Staff are lovely, drinks are fab!"
Gloriosa,5,"Very delicious, everything fresh and seasonal and the best focaccia I have tried Bit on the expensive side but def worth it!"
Six by Nico Finnieston,5,"Fabulous experience sampling The Mad Hatter's Tea Party menu. When each course is served it's expertly explained by serving staff and accompanied by a little theatre.

Absolutely delicious food served in beautifully decorated surroundings. I have read some reviews indicating that the tables are extremely close together. This is true but we didn't find it overly intrusive. Overall a fantastic experience."
Six by Nico Finnieston,5,"Visited here as a treat as it is a bit pricier than some of the local restaurants, but I've wanted to go for a while, and honestly it didn't disappoint. The restaurant is small and usually fully booked, so getting a walk in is unlikely. The staff are attentive and polite without being overbearing. The Thai fusion menu was the theme when we went, the food portions are small, but it is a tasting menu, you are there for the experience, not to get stuffed full. I thought the food was delicious and creative with lots of different elements making up each dish. Being a bit of a fussy/limited eater I wanted to try foods I wouldn't normally eat, and the pumpkin spring roll gave me a whole new appreciation I didn't know was possible for pumpkin. I normally don't eat fish either, but the pan seared bass has completely changed my mind. If you want something a bit different to treat yourself, with a friendly and relaxed atmosphere, then definitely try this place."
Six by Nico Finnieston,5,"Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here. All 6 courses were very tasty, and we thought the wine tasting was fab. Took around 2 hours but did not feel like that at all!"
Six by Nico Finnieston,3,"I love the idea of Six by Nico. But if you aren‚Äôt keen on one or two courses it feels expensive for the rest of the meal.

Dishes were well cooked, albeit not very hot, but well presented and full of interesting flavors.  I don‚Äôt like service change included on the bill, (although it‚Äôs optional) nor the charity donation."
Six by Nico Finnieston,5,"Great experience!
I came here with my family and had a great time. The service was fantastic, the vibe was very happy and excited and the food was good.
The dishes were very creative, interesting to look at tasty.
We all had the matching wines which paired very well. There was a matching cocktail for your first drink which was a nice change as well.

Tasting menu, matching wines, 4x extra cocktail and 2x extra snack course was around ¬£360 for 4 of us.

Had a great time with my family but don't have any intentions coming back for a while, not sure why, just left a little underwhelmed by the flavours."
Ubiquitous Chip,5,"My main is less inspiring ‚Äî ricotta and chestnut croquettes. The powder gives the sprouts a tempura-like crispness. The base of the squash puree is cold, though, and the rocket garnish miserably flaccid. The croquettes themselves are floury ‚Äî overwhelmingly so. One is pleasant; two is a chore."
Ubiquitous Chip,5,Amazing decor.  Great drinks and menu.  Loved having a vegetarian tasting menu.  Wish they advised we needed to specify if we wanted a tasting menu when making our reservation.  Glad they were able to accommodate.  Time in between courses was a bit long.  Looking forward to coming back.
Ubiquitous Chip,5,We had the taster menu with the wine flight. The food and wine were a great match and made the evening great. Service was friendly and good.
Ubiquitous Chip,5,"Definitely the place for a fancy occasion, it's otherwise a bit too pricey for a casual meal. But the service and atmosphere are sublime.

Their selection of ice wines are incredible, and the food overall were delicious. They looked small but were actually very filling!"
Ubiquitous Chip,5,"The inside of The Ubiquitous Chip is worth the trip alone, so incredibly stunning. This is a must! Food & wine is awesome, service was really great! So glad we got a reservation here, added a great experience to our trip!"
Ka Pao Glasgow,5,"Outstanding.  My general rule is if I do not understand the menu items, I do not eat at the restaurant.  This place is one of the few exceptions.  It was chosen by my friend at the recommendation of a local.  The menu is unique and contains many flavor profiles and items that I have never experienced.  We trusted the chef and went with the sharing menu.  The chef is a real artist who put together robust flavors of seemingly strange or unknown ingredients that really complemented each other.  Dont overthink it.  Have a little faith and try these unique creations.  This is New York, LA, Vegas, Paris quality food in Glasgow.  Plenty of food and reasonably priced."
Ka Pao Glasgow,5,"Omg the food is amazing! I can be a bit nervous about trying new foods but virtually every dish (my group basically passed around every dish we ordered so we could all try it) was amazing! The oyster mushrooms in particular were delicious. The staff were so lovely and patient. The entire setup of the restaurant is so pretty.

My one complaint would be that I hated paying ¬£4 for a glass bottle of coca-cola ü§£ but honestly everything was so lovely. I'll definitely be back."
Ka Pao Glasgow,5,"So glad to have come across this restaurant! I love the concept; which is to a order small selection to share (great if you‚Äôre not feeling too hungry and if you want to sample multiple dishes). Definitely recommend the fried chicken, which was so crispy outside and juicy inside, the curries were spot on and deserts were amazing. The staff was great at explaining everything and was very quick to serve us. Definitely would love to come back here again to sample out other items on the menu! ü•∞"
Ka Pao Glasgow,5,"So many dishes too choose from & reasonably priced. I went with my brother and we shared 3 dishes each, which is the optimal amount.

Service was very kind & attentive to our table."
Ka Pao Glasgow,5,"""Ventured into the heart of Glasgow's West End to discover Ka Pao, and it's safe to say, this place left an impression! Nestled in a prime location, it boasts a spacious interior with a welcoming atmosphere.

The staff here are aces ‚Äì speedy and ever-helpful, they make you feel right at home. And let's talk cocktails ‚Äì they don't disappoint!

Now, onto the grub. For a starter, I tried the salt and Szechuan pepper oyster mushrooms with pickled mooli (vg). It was an explosion of flavors! The mushrooms were perfectly crispy on the outside, tender inside, and that soy lime sauce? A symphony of tastes in every bite.

I wondered if the main course could match up, and I went for the hispi cabbage with cashew nut butter and sriracha. The butter was a delight, melting into the cabbage, but the sriracha had a bit too much swagger, making the dish a tad on the salty side.

For dessert, I wrapped up with the coconut pandan and mango calamansi. It was a tropical paradise on a plate! Nutty flavors danced with the freshness of mango, and it was an absolute delight.

With an experience like this, there's no doubt ‚Äì I'll be back for more!"
The Butchershop,5,"One of the bests restaurants I have been to. I reserved seats online before coming for a family of 4...The ambience was great...warm cosy feeling. The waiter who attended to us was fantastic in his approach and very professional. Appetizer came very quickly and main meal followed in good time. You could see attention to detail from the way the food was presented. There was a kids menu with a 3 course meal for 10pounds....which I thought was very good and filling for the kids. My steak and the Mrs were perfect. No complaints whatsoever. I have now received offers from them for a Tomahawk Thursday and look I just have to go back. In all, we spent ¬£125 for all our meals which was made up of ¬£20 of the kids meal. So that gives an idea of what it cost both adults for their meal. No wine bottles..just a glass."
The Butchershop,5,"A large group of us came to The Butchershop for dinner. Our friend, who got married that weekend, had recommended this place as he frequents it with his (now) wife!

It was superb. The wine was incredible, the food came out at perfect temperatures, and the wait staff was attentive and accommodating. We did stay back for an after-dinner drink; we moved over to the bar area so they can seat another reservation. I had an Old-Fashioned and it was made perfectly!

I have to say, their onion rings are delicious!!! There's also vegetarian and gluten free options available, which is lovely!"
The Butchershop,5,Amazing atmosphere and staff were amazing? Kendall was serving us and was superb!
The Butchershop,3,"We were looking forward to our meal at the Butchershop but it was really disappointing. We had ribeye steaks with chips, some sides and dessert. All I can say that the food was edible but didn‚Äôt justify ¬£150. Even the chips lacked flavour, and my rare medium steak was hard to chew. I don‚Äôt know if we got unlucky for ordering a la carte on a Tuesday? We won't be returning."
The Butchershop,5,"Amazing restaurant with fabulous food. The black pudding scotch egg was one of the best starters I've ever had... just delicious.  The steaks were cooked to perfection, with a choice of sauces and sides.  Desserts very tasty.  All in all a great experience.  My new favourite restaurant."
Stravaigin,4,"Excellent place. Even though I didn't know you had to make a reservation, they seated us at the bar area and served great food. Selection was limited because they had a ""busy weekend"" and was out of steak and some other assorted menu items. I had the haggis to start and pork belly as a main. Superb!"
Stravaigin,5,"After a brisk walk through Kelvin Park we arrived at Stravaigin, the Cellar. We were seated after my partner managed to smash a glass through careless control over her hand bag. We were presented with menus and I chose the Haggis Neaps and Tatties which came as three equal sized portions with sesame seeds. I followed this with steak, chips and pepper corn sauce. The waiter checked back on us a few times which was a nice touch. The desert was a small meringue with a sorbet and so apple shavings???
We had coffee, paid the bill and thanked the waiter.
This is a nice place to eat in a busy local venue."
Stravaigin,5,"Great atmosphere, I went in the Christmas time and the restaurant was super cute all covered by lights. The food was ok and the staff was super friendly."
Stravaigin,2,"This restaurant was highly recommended, we came but didn't book a table, we were seated behind the bar and we understood because it was our mistake, but the waiters bypassed us and ignored us, they always left somewhere, we couldn't even call anyone . When it came time to eat, no one informed us that the food we ordered would be so spicy, the menu did not say so. The mussels were peppered with jalape√±o, which was not mentioned on the menu, and the curry prawns were super spicy. When we reported this to the waiter, he said that we should have warned him and he would have brought us yogurt to reduce the burning sensation, this is very funny, we didn‚Äôt  expect this, we expected everything, but not this response. The atmosphere was very good, but the evening was completely ruined."
Stravaigin,5,"Had a fab meal today for Sunday lunch! Felt like royalty and the food was outstanding!
The staff were so attentive especially Ilaeira and Morven, kitchen staff went the full hog and beef roast was just so tender, not sure how they achieve such excellence in taste and flavour but everything was cooked to perfection. Cocktails were also top notch especially the espresso martini! Could have had more if we had more time. Really enjoyed sitting by the cosy fireplace and was nice to be accompanied by a few waggy tails next to us. Really was ant least 5 stars all round, keep being authentic and original!"
Porter & Rye,5,"Every bite of food was so good. Ask the staff which cut to try, they won't steer you wrong. They were very attentive and accommodating. Very cool atmos except for the large painting in the center. Definitely ask about it, though."
Porter & Rye,5,"Nice quiet and warm atmosphere, even on Valentine‚Äôs Day. Food was stellar, servers very friendly and attentive. Always explaining dishes and gave us a few recommendations for drinks etc. For what you get it‚Äôs priced well. It‚Äôs like a better Millar & Carter"
Porter & Rye,5,"Great place for dinner. Great atmosphere and great food. The starters or small plates were excellent, much better than what you might expect from a steak restaurant. The pigeon was great and very well cooked. Could easily do small plate tapas style rather than have steak.

The steaks were excellent too and a decent size. Peppercorn sauce was quite creamy, more to my wife‚Äôs liking, I like a bit more peppery heat but it was still tasty.

The carrots side was excellent, you could really taste the difference between the different types of carrot.

I thought the brownie was a bit dry and couldn‚Äôt really taste the maple or bacon flavours from the menu but it was decent enough. My wife‚Äôs baked Alaska was fantastic.

The do great inventive cocktails too.

I would definitely go back for a quality meal in Glasgow."
Porter & Rye,5,"My husband and I came here for dinner one night of our honeymoon in Scotland. The waitstaff were so pleasant, and they took the time to make little gestures like complimentary glasses of Prosecco before dinner and a ‚ÄúCongratulations on your honeymoon‚Äù display with our dessert.

Our waitress patiently answered all of our questions, and she took the time to talk to the chef when I, as a picky eater, wanted one of the desserts without half of its ingredients, and they figured out how to make a version I could happily eat.

The steak was cooked as we ordered, and my husband enjoyed his drinks. The dessert was good, maybe not great, but we were there for the main meal, and that exceeded what we were looking for."
Porter & Rye,5,"The food was amazing, the sides were big portions

The bread & butter was the best we have ever had

The desserts were so enjoyable

The staff went way beyond with their kindness compared to any other restaurant we have been to"
La Lanterna West End,4,"The La Lanterna brand is held in lofty esteem in Glasgows culinary circles so I had high hopes in trying a fairly affordable lunch deal.

The restaurant itself is quite small and decorated with a simple Mediterranean charm. Bright and airy it feels intimate and upmarket. Location on Great Western Road is a nice compromise between Central and Byres Road.

The food was hearty and flavourful. Rich tomato, fresh and wholesome. At ¬£17.95 for two courses it was good value too.

However, if coming again I would opt for an evening meal as it just felt like it wasn‚Äôt in full flow and more going through the motions. The warm up if you will. Missing the X factor of a little buzz or exceptional service to elevate it to a full five star experience on this occasion. Quasi!!!"
La Lanterna West End,5,"Another great meal, every single plate brought out was perfectly set and tasted fantastic. Can't wait to go back again. Staff very professional and lovely."
La Lanterna West End,5,"Was recommended to come here by one of the owners daughters a few years ago- finally made it and what a delight! Squeezed us in on a busy Saturday night and were attentive as friendly. Food is delicious, I love lasagne and this is up there with the best I‚Äôve had!"
La Lanterna West End,5,"Been here twice and both times were 10/10 for the food, service, atmosphere and just everything in general. Definitely my favourite restaurant to dine in the west end. Came today for my 21st birthday and the staff were lovely and very accommodating. The starter, main and dessert I had were total perfection and the drinks were great also, especially the strawberry margarita ü§©"
La Lanterna West End,5,"First time visit and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. The restaurant was quiet on a Monday lunchtime. The staff were lovely and took us through the various menus on offer. The food was delicious especially the prawn salad. The wine of the month was very drinkable.
Thanks to Penelope for the great service."
Eighty Eight,5,"We had a wonderful meal at this small but cozy restaurant. The food was excellent - bold and full flavours. We love a sharing concept and had 10 plates in total for our group of four. The plates came out at a steady pace, we never felt rushed. Small but good wine selection. The staff was exceptionally friendly and welcoming. We went to other, more expensive restaurants in Glasgow but this was by far our favorite. We spent 245 pounds which included 3 bottles of wine - a very fair price. Absolutely recommend this spot, we will definitely visit again next time we're in the area."
Eighty Eight,5,"This is a lovely little place in the West End of Glasgow. It does small menus and small plates, but everything that comes out of the small kitchen is delicious. Service is friendly and informed. Booking is essential.
We went on a pasta special menu evening."
Eighty Eight,5,Incredible coffee and even better pastries! They have the most gorgeous cups and the atmosphere is really cosy! I personally loved that you were offered a choice of single origin for your coffee and the menu included tasting notes to help you choose. I am keen to return to try out their selections of wine one evening!
Eighty Eight,5,"A new Gem for us.  We have walked by 88 numerous times and always said - looks great we have to try it.  We did - WOW - amazing.  Extremely impressed.   Superb food, flavors out of this world.  Amazing wines by the glass - probably the best wines by the glass I have had in Glasgow - if going by price definitely the best.

Lovely staff, it was quite being a Tuesday right after New Years and we got to chat to the very talented chef and lovely hostess.  Very nice people who love their job.

We will be back to try the cocktail bar and to eat at the restaurant again."
Eighty Eight,4,"Almost a five! The formula is spot on - buzzing vibe, interesting menu, dare to try something different, great staff (even if they are the victim of their own success). 'Small plates in a small restaurant' - yes, a bit on the cramped side. Food was interesting and generally excellent. Not quite sure about all the wine pairings. Reasonable value. Bottom line, absolutely would recommend and look forward to returning."
One Restaurant,5,"Very delicious food and drinks. Quick, modern, and friendly and helpful staff."
One Restaurant,5,"Had afternoon tea today with 3 friends. Food was lovely both choice and amount. Our server Grace  was so attentive and nothing was a bother too her, lovely girl. Setting spacious and very clean. We have been before for afternoon tea and would recommend to anyone for lovely time."
One Restaurant,2,The food was lovely but the service was bad. Had to go and ask for our orders to be taken then again a half hour later to ask where the meal was. When it finally arrived it was delicious but we were too hurried then to really enjoy it.
One Restaurant,5,God food god servive nice and friendly staff. Sorry for my bad England
One Restaurant,3,The food was nice enough but the staff were not very well informed about the food and drink on offer so we're not very helpful when it came to answering questions.
Red Onion,5,"Been meaning to eat here for several years, having tried the food at a BBC Good Food exhibition. My wife's lactose intolerance was a non-issue. We had the pre-theatre fixed price menu (she had the dairy-free version, including a banana fritter). Loads of choice, delicious food, and the service was terrific. The chef even dropped by our table to say hello. Next time we are visiting Glasgow we will definitely be back"
Red Onion,4,"A very cute place. They closed their full menu earlier than their hours indicated. We were able to order from apps and salads. The food was pretty good. It was all cooked well and served prettily. Bathrooms were clean. Service was minimal and mostly forgot us. I couldn't make eye contact with a server to save my life, so it was a pretty thirsty meal for me. Mostly just enjoyed the ambiance. I'd head somewhere else if I was choosing again."
Red Onion,5,"Food superb, one of the best gluten free / coeliac friendly menu options I seen
Staff were lovely &friendly and very attentive but not over bearing so
We would  definitely revisit next time we are in Glasgow"
Red Onion,4,"A lovely small restaurant tucked away on a quiet street close to the city centre. I had lunch with friends and we all enjoyed our food. The waitress went out of her way to accommodate what we wanted, which was a bit different to the usual order of courses. They have a good selection of wines by the glass   and wine to suit all budgets. We won't leave it so long until we go back again."
Red Onion,5,Beautiful restaurant. The food is absolutely delicious and it's a lovely atmosphere. Really great service even when busy.
La Lanterna,3,"Went for a valentine's night dinner, and despite the high praises I have heard about this restaurant, the experience was pretty lackluster. The dinner service was restricted to their set menu for Valentine's day and one could opt for a 2 course meal for 27.50 each or 3 course for 35 each.
My partner ordered a mains and a dessert sharing platter, and I went for a prawn starter and mains. The menu did not state that if you share the dessert platter it will cost extra and after we were reassured by the service staff that it wont be charged separately, when it came down to the billing time, there was an extra 7.5 quid added on top of our 27.50 each. There was also an added service charge, automatically added on top of that, both seems disingenuous to me. I don't mind paying service fee and having worked in the hospitality industry I will gladly hand tips to servers, but this was not acceptable. The extra charge for sharing dessert platter makes no sense, 'cos essentially my partner paid 35 quid for a bowl of pasta and 4 shot glasses worth of desserts.
We were told that the server did not know and she explained it to us incorrectly that it would be included in the price, and only after asking for clarification was one given to us. She also quickly went on to say that she would be happy to take off the service fee, as if doing us a favor while admitting to the fact that she gave us misinformation while taking the order. The whole situation left a bitter after taste, although the main course pasta was pretty good. The dessert platter portion wise was very disappointing especially considering the extra charge.
Food was decent, I liked my risotto but the whole billing experience did not leave me with a positive impression of the place."
La Lanterna,4,"My wife and I had chicken and mushroom risotto, lasagna, and calamari for a starter. The risotto and calamari were great. The lasagna was good, too, but the sauce perhaps a bit burnt, giving the lasagna a smokie taste. The servers were attentive even with the large number of guests and the atmosphere cozy."
La Lanterna,5,"I loved everything about this experience. The food was amazing, and the staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Plenty of options both food and drink. Clean restaurant and toilets.
Best tiramisu I've had."
La Lanterna,4,Great place for a bite to eat. They were able to squeeze us in at short notice. Bruschetta starter was really nice. Main was good but not outstanding.. Desert (homemade tiramisu) was really good. Service was friendly and not overbearing.
La Lanterna,5,"Since we were attending a concert,  we booked this restaurant about 3 months prior to our event and since there was 5 of us wanted to be guaranteed a table.

The menu choices were good, I went with the old classics however my friends all  chose different things and they all looked excellent and with empty plates at the end obviously tasted excellent üëå

Reasonable prices for the food and drinks we had.

Will definitely be back if I'm in Glasgow again. üòÄ"
Ardnamurchan Scottish Restaurant & Bar,5,"According to the recommendation on the Internet, I came to this restaurant for my lunch in Glasgow. This restaurant has a unique set menu during lunch time, two courses is ¬£19.95, three courses is ¬£22.95. Because I don't want to eat dessert, I just order a Oven Baked Lamb Stovies for starters and a Ardnamurchan Estate Braised Wild Venison Stew for mains. The starters - Lamb with a piece of cheddar cheese stewed very soft, and it's delicious with its tangy tomato flavor and baked aroma. The mains - venison stew is rich in side dishes, and the mushrooms and potatoes have a unique taste when paired with the venison. The only downside was that the venison wasn't tender enough, but that was the problem with the venison and not with the restaurant processing it poorly.

I also ordered an oyster, which cost ¬£3. If ordered 6 oysters, it would be ¬£15.  The oyster has a small size but absolutely fresh. Worth to try.

Overall, this restaurant serves very good food.  If you come to Glasgow, please come and try this restaurant!"
Ardnamurchan Scottish Restaurant & Bar,4,"If you are looking for authentic, hearty, well plated Scottish food look no further. It‚Äôs a showcase of local produce in an upscale and well dressed dining area.

Portions and menu can‚Äôt be faulted on this visit but the service felt a bit underwhelming for a special occasion but Im willing to bet that might just be a post Xmas hangover and an off night.

It‚Äôs maybe more formal than some other eateries but it hits all the right notes in culinary craft. A thoroughly satisfactory spot to impress your friends or visitors."
Ardnamurchan Scottish Restaurant & Bar,5,"We've been on vacation in Scotland for 10 days and while we've had some great meals,  this one topped them all!!  The Cullen Skink, to quote my Glaswegian born spouse was 'the best I've ever had'.  The fish & chips and the sirloin with peppercorn sauce were fantastic.   The sticky toffee pudding was superb!  The wine list is good.  The cocktails were lovely - try the Orange Chocolate Espresso Martini!  The service was outstanding - thank you Grier!"
Ardnamurchan Scottish Restaurant & Bar,4,"Staff was very nice and attentive!

Food: The scallops were super fresh and delicious! The goat cheese salad was also quite nice. The lambo shank wasn‚Äôt that great - the dried out broccoli was nice though. The best was the chestnut risotto and the sticky toffee pudding. Those two dishes I‚Äôd recommend in a heartbeat!"
Ardnamurchan Scottish Restaurant & Bar,4,"I asked for a medium rare steak, but I got medium well. I wasn't happy about it

It was my wifes birthday and the first time Scottish restaurant . It was a beautiful and very nice experience . The cocktails were nice
Espresso matini made my wife's day .

The fish soup was fantastic
Haggis was beautiful and earthy

My wife's venison was cooked to perfection

Sticky toffee pudding was to die for. However, there was a pitt of date in one of the bites.

In all, it was good"
Chaophraya,5,"I really enjoyed a fantastic meal here with excellent food of high quality. We ordered the set menu which was ¬£43 per person. We got a very good mixture of starters, three main meals and rice, followed by a chocolate mousse for dessert.  The food was very very tasty. The building and restaurant area were exquisitely decorated all Thai themed."
Chaophraya,5,"This was my first time here.  The food was great, the atmosphere was relaxed, all the staff were nice. Will be visiting again.  We went for the 3 coarse lunch menu. With a couple of add on's prawn crackers and 2 egg fried rice to accompany our main dishes and 2 large wines we paid ¬£84 for 2 people."
Chaophraya,5,"We stumbled upon Chaophraya while exploring Glasgow. It stands out as a gastronomic gem, offering the tastiest and most flavourful dishes we've ever had.

The authentic decor and vibes added an extra layer of enjoyment, creating an immersive experience that transported us to the heart of Asia. The genuine atmosphere complemented the outstanding culinary offerings.

Highly recommend for anyone seeking an unparalleled Asian dining experience that combines exceptional flavours with authentic ambiance."
Chaophraya,5,Got vouchers for Christmas last year and finally went. Good selection of food and reasonable prices. We got the sharing platter as a starter and it was delicious. Got the specials for our mains a bit disappointed that you had to order rice or noodles separately
Chaophraya,4,"The entrance and interior decor of the restaurant are quite splendid, creating a fantastic ambiance. Booking a table in advance over the phone is very convenient. The flavor of the dishes is comparable to Ting Thai in the West End, but the prices are 2-3 times higher. This Thai restaurant in Glasgow is the only one offering Mongo Sticky Rice with Coconut Milk and Pineapple Rice, adding a unique touch. Lamb curry was average, and the portion sizes are rather small. A service charge of 12.5% is applied, which falls in the mid-range. The staff is reasonably friendly."
Miller & Carter Glasgow,5,"Absolute quality, the food is phenomenal and service is second to none! Remember though‚Ä¶it is a steakhouse!!! The starter of sticky chipotle chicken is amazing, T-bone steak (medium/rare) is fantastic and apple crumble with custard is just excellent! Our server Ryan was extremely polite, helpful and very professional! The whole experience was amazing! üåü ‚≠êÔ∏è üí´"
Miller & Carter Glasgow,5,"First time I've been .
This was a 1st date
We arrived early so sat next to the bar waiting on our table .
Very busy evening

Female server was informative & attentive.

Toilets down steep stairs struggled a bit with high heels on however
Very clean .

The steak was cooked to perfection peppercorn sauce  potatoes & fries tasty.
Could not fault it

The white zinfadel (Rose) was a good accompaniment to the food.

Don't know the cost as my date paid however the food was worth it .

Would come back.."
Miller & Carter Glasgow,5,"Stunning building, grand dining room and plenty of space between tables. Pleasant atmosphere and our server was lovely. Now the food. Possibly one of, if not, the best fillet steaks I've ever had. Also this was on a Sunday so it was about ¬£35 per person for 3 courses, so good. Also the desert was delicious, the ice cream with mango sorbet and raspberry compote, comes in a shell of mango chocolate, highly recommend. Also the onion loaf is their answer to onion rings and I'm converted!"
Miller & Carter Glasgow,3,"Overrated and disappointing experience.

Positive: Service from staff is excellent. Atmosphere is fantastic. Food comes out very prompt compared to most places.

Negative: The food is not the best that it so likes to boast about. Starters are tiny and had better steaks elsewhere (additionally; I asked for medium rare and got rare, partner asked for medium well and got medium). The main also is very sparse for a typical steak dinner, no vegetables as you need to choose between chips OR veg, why?! The most desolate steak dinner I have ever seen."
Miller & Carter Glasgow,5,"I would really like to thank Miller & Carter for our anniversary dinner.  We managed to get a lovely booth at 8pm at night on valentines day.                                       Our server Jess was extremely helpful.   As my wife wasn't sure what stake to have .  But Jess guided her through the options & helped her choose the perfect stake .
Our stakes were done to perfection as always & gave them back clean plates üòã.
The place has a lovely atmosphere  &  always clean & tidy.
Just to say a special thanks to Jess for organising a lovely sweet for my wife .
With Happy Anniversary written on her plate .   It made her feel even more special ü§ó."
The butterfly and the pig,4,The food was fantastic! The Colin Coley and cauliflower veggie appetizer was fantastic! The sticky toffee pudding was OK. We need a bigger plate and moist pudding. We also created some ambience by lighting our candle. The steak pie looks delicious. My partner and his friend said it was good. We will return!
The butterfly and the pig,5,"Lovely wee place with loads of mismatched tea-sets and teapots! Very cosy and the food was great. You could order the Afternoon Tea (which was NOT expensive for an afternoon tea; I was expecting to pay almost double before I saw the menu) or you could get regular breakfast food, like a really nice Eggs Benedict or French Toast. These were all delicious according to the group I was with! Would definitely recommend, especially if you'd like to bring someone for a nice Afternoon Tea and chat!"
The butterfly and the pig,5,"we ordered Crissssspy mushroom frittersss served with spicy mayo and a side salad, Suzie the smoked salmon mousse, hitting snooze on a bed of toast, served with a side salad, Butterfly and piglet burger and The swimming piggies... Pan seared king scallops served on a black pudding crumb with crispy pork belly, chorizo oil and a smoked bacon salt. The food is wonderful very creative."
The butterfly and the pig,4,"Really nice food. Pricing for drinks was a bit exorbitant but the great service made up for the cost for sure.

They were even so kind as to make our afternoon tea vegetarian friendly at absolutely no notice because I was an idiot and forgot that I was bringing my vegetarian friend with me. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ

Lovely selection of nibbles within the afternoon tea and great value for what you get.

The soup was also amazing. ü•∞

Would definitely come again and want to try their restaurant next time!"
The butterfly and the pig,5,"It's such a cute place, definitely worth a visit. Book a table as it's busy and you may need to sit in the basement which isn't as atmospheric. The food was very tasty and affordable too."
Mini Grill Steakhouse - Glasgow,4,"Nice atmosphere and lovely food! I enjoyed the fillet steak, very nicely cooked, although was more impressed by my partner's dish of choice which was a Trio of Lamb, truly beautiful dish and delicious. Staff were friendly and attentive. The chips that came with the steak were amazing! It's a small but cosy restaurant, I like that the place is central but in a quieter location on Bath Street."
Mini Grill Steakhouse - Glasgow,5,We visited here to celebrate my wife‚Äôs birthday and this place did not disappoint. Both Trisha and Emma greeted us with such a lovely warm welcome and looked after us just perfectly. The food is absolutely amazing. We are not going to wait for a birthday until we go back. Love this place.
Mini Grill Steakhouse - Glasgow,5,"Absolutely loved it. My new favourite restaurant.
I had food envy before I'd even ordered because the menu is so good and I knew I'd miss out on something.
Haggis trio was some of the best haggis I've had. I begrudgingly went for lamb (instead of steak, in a steak place, I know), and that shepherd's pie is genuinely the nicest mouthful of food I've ever eaten.
Staff were excellent. Nice atmosphere, cosy but not too crowded. Good wine. A little pricey, but worth it!"
Mini Grill Steakhouse - Glasgow,5,We were recommended the restaurant and were not disappointed.  From the welcome and service from Tricia.  TO the food and wine. Everything was excellent.  Trivia gave us great advice on what we ordered and she was spot on. The chateaubriand for two was perfect. Perhaps one of the most delicious steaks I've ever had.
Mini Grill Steakhouse - Glasgow,5,"At Mini Grill in Glasgow, you can expect both outstanding steak and impeccable service. The steak offerings are simply exceptional, prepared to perfection and bursting with flavor. The attention to detail in cooking and presentation is evident in every bite. The service provided by the staff is equally impressive ‚Äì attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. This winning combination of great steak and top-notch service makes Mini Grill a must-visit destination for those seeking an unforgettable dining experience."
The Left Bank,5,"This place never lets you down. Welcoming staff, wide selection of  menus - and including vegetarian and separate vegan menus - and they accept dogs!
This time I had the vegetarian Indian Pole Bowl. So delicious, freshest of ingredients and super filling. Happy ‚≠êÔ∏èHappy ‚≠êÔ∏è Happy‚≠êÔ∏è"
The Left Bank,5,"Fantastic experience! Delectable food and super reasonable prices. Our waiter was kind, patient, and lovely to chat with. The food came out quickly and we loved everything. I would absolutely recommend the eggs with smoked salmon and one of the refreshing seltzers. If I'm ever in Glasgow again, I'll make sure to stop by this place for some delicious food and great people."
The Left Bank,5,"This is an absolutely spot-on place for atmosphere, service & food.  It's not cheap but definitely NOT overpriced for the quality, taste and service of food.
I went with the chef's soup of the day (coconut & tumeric) accompanied with toasted sourdough bread and astoundingly salubrious and flavoursome olives - fresh water is served at every table.
Staff are lovely and genuinely helpful.
Will return! üíñ"
The Left Bank,5,"Must visit!

incredible service. Enjoyed the most delicious Xmas dinner here. The staff were excellent and supporting big group bookings and the process of organising with them was super smooth. The food was divine! Roast was perfection, bean cassoulet was wow. Credits to the chef and to the wonderful staff. A special thanks especially to Callum who made the meal out extra special. I‚Äôll be back and recommending the left bank to anyone looking for delicious food with excellent service in the west end"
The Left Bank,4,"My colleague recommended this brunch cafe to me, so I decided to drop in for a quick meal. The staff were exceptionally friendly. I ordered a bank breakfast and a pot of breakfast tea. Overall, the food was good, but the mushrooms and bean were too cold. Additionally, I wasn't provided with any cutlery at the beginning of my meal, so I had to request a fork and knife from the staff later on. Despite these minor inconveniences, I might still recommend the place overall."
Glaschu Restaurant & Bar,5,"Sunday was an absolute delight with my partner! The experience was beyond wonderful. The waiter was very accommodating, a friendly and warm demeanor. The restaurant's ambiance struck the perfect balance between classy sophistication and a laid-back, relaxing vibe. Food and drinks - they were simply amazing, I wholeheartedly recommend this place with a resounding 100% and can't wait to return!"
Glaschu Restaurant & Bar,2,"Have to say, slightly disappointed! This was a birthday present for me bought by my friends. Service was good, very attentive. Appetisers were probably the best thing about the meal, sourdough bread with chicken butter was lovely, as was the salmon cornet. I had roast of the day, the chicken was dry, Yorkshire pudding was rock hard and inedible. Desert of lime and coconut was just not nice at all. Far too sweet. Really wish I had not ordered that! My husband has beef which was very tough. All in all, I was very disappointed.  I had high expectations due to the reputation, but unfortunately, I would not return as this experience put me right off. Prices are far too high to have poor food! Vibes seem to be very posh, but the food needs to keep up with this or people will not return. Real shame!"
Glaschu Restaurant & Bar,3,"A very nice restaurant with brilliant service from staff. The food was quite nice but I wouldn't really say amazing. Being blunt, it doesn't warrant the prices they charge. I've been to restaurants with more flavourful dishes for much less. Not sure I'd be going back here in future in all honesty."
Glaschu Restaurant & Bar,5,"Location on the first floor of the western club Glasgow.

beautiful interior, low lighting and patterned carpet to the first floor.

The restaurant design is chic, modern.

Good value 2/3 course meal with a discount if member of the western club.

The heritage tomato with goat cheese on puff pastry was excellent.

The coley with clams and sauce was also excellent. Coley was crispy on the outside and just done on the inside. Nice greens too.

Pinot noir was good.

Service attentive."
Glaschu Restaurant & Bar,3,Service was inattentive. Did not provide steak knives for venison. Server disappeared for smoke break. Banana bread for dessert tasted uncooked. Scallops were properly cooked. Serving sizes were misery. Disappointing experience.
Zizzi - Glasgow West End,3,"First time at Zizzi‚Äôs, but was not the best experience. Some of the items we ordered were great, (like the Truffle & Panceta Carbonara) but some others were quite forgettable (like the Primavera pizza, which was quite dry).

The thing we disliked the most was how long it took for the food to arrive: 4 main courses took almost an hour to arrive, and it was just a pasta dish, a single pizza, a calzone and one final chicken dish.

Overall the food is good but if you‚Äôre short on time, maybe look for another one."
Zizzi - Glasgow West End,2,"Had the garlic bread and the pizza primavera. The bread was very good but the pizza was okay at best. On a non-busy night, the wait time was over an hour. Very friendly staff, though."
Zizzi - Glasgow West End,2,"For years we've been happy with Zizzis, then got bored with their menu. The last visit was in Cardiff where we walked out after it took so long to  take our order in a not so busy restaurant.  However, yesterday we managed to order our lunch.

The calamari were good, the mushrooms on bruschetta starters also were acceptable. But just as we expected the mains to arrive  we were, rather late, told, there was no beef chianti ragu. Rush on? Err no, it was only about 12 and the three other tables weren't eating it.

Anyway, when the bolognese replacement arrived it was its usual quality, which I quite like if I'm honest. My mother was Italian, I know my pasta.  However,  The salmon? oh dear the salmon.  I tried it and gave her half my main in the end. I like salt, but my goodness, had I taken my blood pressure after eating it, the Mercury would have shot out and gone into low earth orbit. You can see from the images the carbonara was curdled with small lumps and not creamy. Was it reheated while the ragu replacement was being replaced?  Perhaps we should have rejected it on arrival...  Anyway the close up picture was what wasn't eaten in the end.  They were apologetic and a generous discount added to the bill, but that's it for Zizzis for us now.

We have a discount voucher for the Zizzi clone, Ask, let's see out that pans out next."
Zizzi - Glasgow West End,4,"Went for lunch today, was welcomed by a friendly blonde lady. The part of the restaurant we requested to sit in was unavailable due to the roof having came in which was disappointing however the food made up for that :) beautiful meal and friendly staff. Definitely would recommend üëå"
Zizzi - Glasgow West End,3,Good potential atmosphere was ruined by lots of screaming kids. Our waitress was excellent. Saturday lunchtime is best avoid if you don't have kids. Maybe we were just unlucky.
Partick Duck Club,4,"Tasty and great atmosphere. But I paid ¬£2.75 for ONE slice of black pudding. That is very dear despite the cost of living crisis.

I did check with the waiter if it was only one slice and the answer was 'yes'.

Apart from this, it's a great place with a great service."
Partick Duck Club,4,"I was on the fence about removing a star but in the end I decided it was more accurate to give 4/5.

We both had the 12 hour Barbary leg and shared a portion of fries. The food was absolutely delicious, the duck more or less fell off the bone and such a tasty sauce.

The star removed was for two reasons
a) the bathroom - it was a tad dark, a shelf was too close to the toilet itself (I banged my arm against it) and the sink has a tendency to splash because the water pressure is too high for the sink design
b) there was a used, slightly fusty straw in between the seat cushions and there were some crumbs already there when we sat down."
Partick Duck Club,5,"What a treat! Great selection of food and drinks and a live buzzing atmosphere . be sure to make a reservation to avoid disappointment. They have a a good non alcoholic drink menu and vegetarian options too. I really enjoyed the boneless chicken and my partner enjoyed the scottosh fry up, the duck fries are delightful too - just the right amount of salt for that extra flavour !"
Partick Duck Club,5,Wonderful breakfast if you want something a little different. We both ordered the duck leg hash. It was surprisingly spicy which I love and the bread was incredible. Service was also fantastic. Can't wait to visit for dinner!
Partick Duck Club,5,"All day breakfast + all day lunch + dinner (we went on Saturday).  Really great, and good coffee too. I paid ¬£20 for eggs benedicte with avocado and bacon + 2 x coffees. We booked ahead for breakfast, I think it gets very busy so plan ahead."
Halloumi Glasgow,5,"Excellent food, beautiful interior and great service. The food was ready fast. The only complaint is that the table surface was sticky, even the napkins were stick to the table because of stickiness.

We tried chips with Halloumi, Lamb Moussaka which were both good and Lamb chops, the lamb chops was one of the best chops I‚Äôve ever had."
Halloumi Glasgow,5,"Food was amazing. Highly recommend the feta tempura, was sooo good. The gyros was great also. The music was good and the staff were really friendly. Will return again"
Halloumi Glasgow,4,"Lovely high quality Greek food from a very broad menu. We were a group of 6 celebrating a birthday.
Service was very friendly from very polite and attentive staff.
Wasn't cheap and the wine was a bit over priced.
We were in on a Sunday afternoon in January,  so it wasn't busy, bit quiet, no great atmosphere.
All good though. Really enjoyed it and will definitely go back."
Halloumi Glasgow,5,First visit. Will definitely be going back. Food was delicious. Staff were lovely.
Halloumi Glasgow,5,"My family and I popped in for a lunch today to celebrate my mums birthday and it didn‚Äôt disappoint.
The staff worked really hard today despite the challenges of the day, and we left a ¬£15 tip to thank them, and to to help show some appreciation for how they handled the day. I‚Äôll definitely be going back, we‚Äôre a notoriously a fussy family with exploring new foods, so it was lovely to eat so many new things we enjoyed.
Manager was such a lovely man and we wish the staff the best"
Roma Mediterranean Restaurant,2,Beware of expensive add ons!! The portions are decently sized but the food is so extremely bland. I had the chicken carbonara and the chicken tasted old and chewy. The carbonara had no taste at all and I had to heavily salt it to make it edible. The pollo al Pepe and the steak were so average for the prices we were paying. The garlic bread also had no taste whatsoever. The cocktails were delicious but often the food would come before the drinks. However the staff were nice and the atmosphere was cute. Such bad value for money as the prices were absolutely extortionate!!
Roma Mediterranean Restaurant,3,"The place was good, service was amazing, we ordered pizza and garlic bread. but the pizza crust was overcooked. The garlic bread was lacking flavours."
Roma Mediterranean Restaurant,4,First time visit to Roma Mediterranean Restaurant and was actually surprised at how big it is inside. It's a bit like a Tardis! Hadn't booked but there were plenty of tables available. Nice decor and the atmosphere was pretty good. Nice little booths where you can sit and chat easily without being overpowered by noise from elsewhere. Food was all good and very tasty. The only downside for me was the automatic addition of a 10% gratuity to the bill. I usually like to decide for myself if the service was worthy of a tip. Overall though I would recommend it as the food was really nice. üëçüèª
Roma Mediterranean Restaurant,4,Really nice restaurant. Service was very good and I enjoyed the food.
Roma Mediterranean Restaurant,5,"I went here for my birthday dinner with my wife. Booked it on 5pm deal. Staff acknowledge this straight away. Got a lovely table brought out our wine and asked if we wanted some water. We ordered starters and an amazing steak. I had the Diane sauce which was amazing and my wife had the red wine sauce. I would defo go back. Tip is already put on your bill. The 5pm deal was 2 course Sunday to Wednesday with a bottle of wine ¬£49.25.
Thank you"
Sugo Pasta,5,With no booking we only had a short wait for a table for 2 of us and a pram even though it was very busy on a Friday afternoon. Small menu but food was absolutely amazing. Good portion sizes and service was very quick.
Sugo Pasta,5,"Food is delicious. Service very fast, lovely decor and surroundings. My only complaint is that the waiting staff tended to linger and continually come over to the table which was put people on edge, I noticed other tables around me saying the same thing. Folk just want to be left to eat in peace so this would be my only bit of feedback."
Sugo Pasta,5,"Incredible pasta with incredible speed! I went on a Monday night, around 5 pm and only had to wait 5 minutes to be seated - speedy! Then I ordered drinks and pasta for me and my friend (the waitress was very lovely) and within 10-15 minutes of waiting, our food arrived - super speedy!! It was so delicious, I could only think about this incredible meal for the next 4 days following our visit. Oh, and I would highly recommend trying their affogato; it‚Äôs unlike any other I‚Äôve had before! Sweet and smooth with a gelato-like texture without any hint of bitterness, to die for. I hope I find myself in Glasgow again to pop by for another experience at Sugo!"
Sugo Pasta,5,"30 min waiting was worth it. One of the best selection of pasta, amazing service, perfectly cooked dishes and delicious desserts. A perfect place for Italian food !"
Sugo Pasta,5,"Incredible. Still can't get over the atmosphere, food quality and service here. Loved every bit. We stumbled across the restaurant as we walked the mural trail. It looked busy so we thought a late lunch would work as we had our bags. It was still busy but the staff were more than capable. Highly Highly recommend. We all loved our food. We even asked the owner if they would consider setting up in Dublin."
Las Iguanas - Glasgow,5,"Monica was lovely. This was our first meal out since getting married and she was super friendly. Service was very quick and she was very attentive, always checking on us for drinks and making sure our food was good. We are very happy! And can't wait to return. Thank you! She even gave us a glass of prosecco to congratulate us which I thought was a lovely touch."
Las Iguanas - Glasgow,5,"Very big space with an impressive variety. Love the fact that they put calories on the menus. And if you check the online menu you can even find the macros for the dishes. So rare! So useful!

Had üêî fajitas that were very tasty and fresh."
Las Iguanas - Glasgow,4,"We went on a Tuesday night, so it wasn't busy, but they do have a ton of seating. The atmosphere was amazing, and so did the interior. The wait on drinks and food wasn't too long. Food wise, I think it's a little overpriced for the quality and amount, but it's still good. The cocktails, though, are delicious. I definitely recommend the mango collins. The staff was also very polite"
Las Iguanas - Glasgow,5,"Food was absolutely delicious, we ordered 6 tapas dishes to share and every single one was amazing. Would definitely be back. We also turned up half an hour early on the off chance we could be seated early and they managed to squeeze us in. Staff all lovely and helpful."
Las Iguanas - Glasgow,4,"Always love coming to Las Iguanas. Great cocktails, fab food, although one of my favourite sides has now changed. Usually get the roasted cauliflower, which is dusted and roasted to perfection with spices, however on this visit, the cauliflower is now tiny little pieces dunked in a thick stodgy batter. So your getting half the amount of cauliflower and a bug bowl full of batter, to be honest it's unrecognisable as cauliflower.Very disappointing, these dishes are expensive for what they are, but usually worth it for the flavour, but not in this case. Bring back the original recipe. Cocktails amazing as and service with a smile from our bearded server, who couldn't do enough x"
Topolabamba,5,"Fantastic meal following a long day at work. I have the chicken tinga tacos and shredded beef tostados. Both were excellent and left just the right amount of tingle on the tongue.

Espresso martini was also a delight. I would really struggle to find fault with my visit as staff were also excellent"
Topolabamba,4,"This place looks really nice, but I don‚Äôt think that food is that great. Prices are okay, but I ordered Chicken Chimichanga and it was quite bland. Virgin Margaritas are pretty small. Also, they add 10% service even if you‚Äôd order only drinks and be in a group that is Less than 5 people (most places are adding 10% when group is bigger than 5 people, so I was really surprised)."
Topolabamba,4,"Went to try the Mexican food in Glasgow. Amazing taste, Great Prices and Just sufficient portions. Decor is amazing, staff is friendly and courteous. Definitely recommended."
Topolabamba,4,"Probably the best mexican restaurant I've been to in Glasgow, well apart from Bibis but that's a different experience and not central.

Foods really good, service is excellent and it's a good atmosphere.  Nothing to fault really.  Been twice and wouldn't hesitate to go back

Still not as good as taco van in LA tho ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Topolabamba,5,"Went here after a friend recommended it, and it was during the cycle race so super busy. Waitress was super nice, front of staff guy lacked a bit of personality. Atmosphere and food was delicious. I found 4 tapas plates too much for me to eat, but they happily put it in a takeaway box for me to finish off later. The family & I will eat here again when we are in Glasgow next time."
G≈çst,5,"Absolutely fantastic festive lunch. Started with a simple
Booking process, the restaurant was very accommodating to our various needs - we were a group of 23. Food was tremendous, very tasty, good time between courses and plenty of it üòÇ. Staff looked after the whole group very well, no long waiting that you would expect at this time of year. Drinks were excellent too, great selection of cocktails. We will be back.. cheers"
G≈çst,5,Best steak restaurant in Glasgow. Service from Andrew was wonderful. We were greeted to a lovely booth and the atmosphere was spot on. The food was that good we managed to squeeze in a dessert üòÑ
G≈çst,5,"Delighted with my experience at Gosht restaurant! Introducing a friend to Scotland, I sought a quality halal steakhouse, and Gosht exceeded expectations. The ambience was lovely, service warmly welcoming. The sirloin steak was a revelation‚Äîundeniably the best I've ever had, incredibly juicy. The mocktails were beautifully crafted. While it leaned towards the pricey side, the exceptional fine dining experience made it worthwhile for special occasions. A special shout-out to Ellie, Rueben, and the talented chef who made our evening memorable on Friday, 26th January."
G≈çst,4,"Overall a pleasant dining experience. Dishes were hit and miss. Snails were rather blend and tasteless, raw oysters were small but tasty and fresh, scallops were good, however the ribeye steak was the highlight of all. Tender juicy well aged and perfectly grilled, one of the best in town. Most staff are friendly and attentive, we were late due to having too much fun in another cocktail bar prior to coming for dinner, the front door lady was not happy and you can tell from her face and her tone of voice, that made us felt uncomfortable and guilty, there were many empty tables and wasn‚Äôt that full while we arrived but she was putting on a wide smile when we left."
G≈çst,5,"Visited over the weekend with friends, we were hosted by Nicole who was absolutely spot on. She went above and beyond for us to ensure we were able to get exactly what it was we were looking for. Her colleague Andrew was great too. The food was great, there was something for everyone, drinks were cracking especially the cocktail - 'Spectre'. Thank you both & to the rest of the team for a great experience."
The Finnieston,5,"Great quality good portions and dog friendly what more could you ask for??

In case you do bring your dog, the rat traps are humane. Which can make them rather tasty for your dog should they go hunting under your chairs"
The Finnieston,5,"I really liked this place. It's nice, cosy and well decorated on the inside. The food was very well presented and most importantly was delicious. I tried the gnocchi and I have to say it was something else, would highly recommend. Shrimp Mac n cheese was average. The staff were delightful and made the whole experience better. Great stuff. Given the prices though I would expect nothing less - it's all rather expensive."
The Finnieston,3,"Nice staff but it‚Äôs really expensive for super small portions !! What you see in the picture (the two tiny scallops) were 18¬£ ! I‚Äôm still hungry we had to go to Mac Donald‚Äôs‚Ä¶ oops‚Ä¶

*Edit : I wrote the above review when I was hungry but I now understand the pricing better, thanks for taking the time to answer !"
The Finnieston,5,"I got to celebrate my birthday at The Finnieston and had an absolutely incredible dining experience.
First I should emphasise that you need to get a reservation. Even if you think it's going to be a slow day or want to try your luck, eat your pride and reserve the table. We watched lots of people get very sadly turned away.
Also, this place is dog friendly so bring your well behaved companion for other customers to baby talk to.
The service here was so good. I was torn between different dishes and the server very kindly suggested an off the menu seafood platter. It had everything I was wanting to try from the entrees, but on a platter. The portion was incredibly generous for myself and my partner and the accompanying chips were fried perfectly. We also got a spiced Panna Cotta which was great and I thoroughly enjoyed the cocktail selection. We'll definitely be back and The Finnieston has a permanent spot on my list of recommendations for visitors."
The Finnieston,4,"The food was quite tasty but the portions were small, in my opinion. So, I think it is slightly overpriced for what you get (I might just be biased though as I haven't been to many seafood restaurants in the UK).

The table was sticky, which gave the impression it hadn't been cleaned properly.

The atmosphere of the place was quite nice though, and the staff was friendly."
Elia Greek Restaurant,4,"I booked a table for a birthday dinner at 7pm on a Sunday. We had 5 starters and 4 mains. A bottle of Prosecco to share, two cocktails and a pint. The food is delicious and the table service is excellent. Total bill was ¬£153 excluding a tip. Very good value for quality dining."
Elia Greek Restaurant,5,"We dined here today for lunch and we‚Äôre so glad that we picked Elia!
Location is very central and is opposite the Christmas Market on George Square. We had a friendly greeting and were seated straight away even though the restaurant was busy. We opted for the Meze for Two which consisted of starters, mains, desert and coffee all for ¬£58. The dishes were all chefs choice apart from the desert which we could choose. We enjoyed every single dish and got to try things that we may never have ordered. Great service from the waiting staff too. Overall very happy with our visit and will come back."
Elia Greek Restaurant,4,"Beautiful, fresh food. I've been wanting to try here for a while and so glad we finally did. Service was good and we were given complimentary bread, olives and oil, which was nice. My only complaint would be for starters we ordered hummus and tzatziki which came on big plates, we were given 1 pitta between 2 people. I feel for the amount in each starter we could have done with a pitta each. We would definitely return."
Elia Greek Restaurant,5,"You can smell the delicious food before entering the restaurant!

We tried the lunch menu which have a good amount of options already. The dolma is really tasty, so are the tzatziki with pita bread. I had the lamb souvlaki and its sooo tender, cooked literally to perfection, the portion size is pretty big, thoroughly enjoyed that. My friend ordered the Smyrneika, the meatballs are nice but a bit salty, the sauce is amazing tho.

The service is great, they had a large menu and plenty seatings, will definitely come back to try more food! Highly recommend this place!"
Elia Greek Restaurant,5,"One of my favourite dining establishments and maybe the best Greek in Glasgow. Terrific food, reasonable prices, and excellent service. Worth booking."
The Citizen Glasgow,5,"That Shetland mussels was a must have. The flavor was just insanely good. Good portion size too!

The steak sandwich was fantastic too!

That Burger though was slightly on the dry side unfortunately. The chips were cut in special shape to enhance taste and well cooked.

Great friendly service! Will definitely come back again!"
The Citizen Glasgow,5,"Visited The Citizen for a belated Christmas work meal and it did not disappoint!
The staff were very welcoming and friendly. I went for the Korean Crispy Chicken starter - absolutely delicious, full of flavour!
I had the Harissa Lamb Shank for main and so glad I did! The lamb fell off the bone, there was so much meat! The truffle mash was delicious and the honey roast carrots & crispy onions tasted delicious!
Enjoyed the meal so much, I went for a dessert, the chocolate and baileys cheesecake. Delicious end to a lovely meal!
Would definitely be back and would recommend."
The Citizen Glasgow,5,"We had our works Christmas night out here. The atmosphere is great. A lot of these places will blare out loud music. But this was kept a low volume here. So you can engage in conversations while the music just soothes in background.

I ordered the haggis-turkey-sticky toffee pudding. All excellent choices. Turkey was quite juicy.

Would definitely come here again."
The Citizen Glasgow,5,"Nice restaurant with good atmosphere. Variety of drinks, good and fast service.
Different options of meat, chicken, and fish plates."
The Citizen Glasgow,5,My favourite. I've been many times and never once has there been the slightest thing to complain about. The food and drinks are of very high standard and the service you get is always the absolute best. I just love it here.
Osteria Glasgow,4,"Osteria is located at 17 John Street, Glasgow (within Merchant City).  It's a 10 to 15 minute walk from Glasgow Central.

The food we ordered was lovely. We had the chicken burger with fries and spaghetti carbonara (the carbonara was quite creamy), with bruschetta classica. For dessert, cheesecake of the day (it was lemon, very soft and airy). We also had a banana split. Big thumbs up!

There were two nice members of staff alternatively waiting on people. The restaurant layout itself is very welcoming. The main part is probably the best area for people who may have any mobility problems. To the left and right of the bar, going up a few steps, you'll find seating. There is a very spacious disabled toilet located to the right of the bar area. It was spotless.

Accessibility to the upstairs part of the restaurant and the ladies and gents toilets is via a spiral staircase. Again, the toilet facilities were gleaming.

I think this restaurant may be dog friendly as well.

Continuing on a canine theme, the S.O.T.B cocktails were the puppy's bow wows!!!! I would go to this restaurant again."
Osteria Glasgow,4,"üçïüçù Stepped into this Italian joint Osteria in Glasgow, that had me feelin' like I just stumbled into a scene from The Godfather!

üíº The atmosphere was as authentic as a Sicilian grandma's secret recipes, and the joint was bigger than Don Corleone's empire! üíºüèõÔ∏è They've got more pizza and pasta variations than mob bosses have aliases ‚Äì capisce? üçïüçù And let me tell ya, the music was thumpin' like a beat-up Cadillac cruisin' down Mulberry Street! üöóüé∂

Now, the cheesecake, fuhgeddaboudit! It was as big as a suitcase full of cash, but sweet enough to give a rival sugar rush!

But let's talk 'bout that colossal calzone ‚Äì it was so massive, I half expected a violin case to be smuggled inside! üéª And the price? Let's just say it's an offer you can't refuse! üí∏ Now, the food prep time, it was quicker than a getaway car at midnight ‚Äì 14 minutes flat, no funny business. ‚è≤Ô∏èüåÉ"
Osteria Glasgow,5,"I came here the other week with a friend. My only qualm was I couldn't finish my main course because I wasn't feeling well! Staff were attentive and helpful, food was lovely and reasonably priced. Will definitely be back"
Osteria Glasgow,5,"Wonderful Italian restaurant! The food was great, the staff were attentive and the place itself is lovely. Would highly recommend."
Osteria Glasgow,4,"Lovely little Italian restaurant in the heart of Glasgow city centre. Very polite staff and very good food. Fast service coupled by home made Italian food, what more do you want. Also recent award winners! Give it a go, you won't be disappointed."
Pulcinella,5,"My partner and I tried this restaurant as we couldn‚Äôt decide where and what to eat on a Wednesday night. They have the 2 or 3 course dinner menu which is absolutely smashing with great prices (less than ¬£19 for 2 course). We had the grilled asparagus and prawn cocktail salad, Turkey with cranberry sauce and Chicken with mushroom sauce.. To our surprise, we love every dish here. We had a wonderful dinner, the food served were all fresh, delicious and generous in portions. Servers are all prompt and attentive. The ambience here is warm, inviting and authentic.
Definitely will bring friends here."
Pulcinella,3,"Basic Italian restaurant .
Food was ok.
The restaurant is a little bit old but with lot‚Äôs of Italian items :)"
Pulcinella,5,"Busy Saturday night but the staff couldn't have been more accommodating. Food was delicious, my two year old loved his pasta. We couldn't resist trying some ourselves.
Melt in the mouth salmon, house wine was really really nice. Looking forward to going back."
Pulcinella,5,"Myself and two friends were looking for somewhere to eat last night (it was a saturday) and stumbled upon Pulcinella.
Even though we didn't have a reservation, they found a table for us, and the managed was very welcoming.
The waiters were all very polite and efficient with one of taking a photo for us as we couldn't manage to get all of us in the photo.
We all ordered our 2 courses and when the food came I have to say it was some of the best I've tasted. I had bruschetta for a starter, and it was so fresh and bursting with tomato flavour. For my main I had a pizza and it was one of the best pizzas I've eaten in my life
My two friends also thoroughly enjoyed their food too with everyone complimenting how good it was.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is perfect, it's very homey and welcoming. I think it is a great all-around place that would be perfect for romantic dates and also for family meals and whatnot.

All in all, I know the next time I visit Glasgow, this will be one of my go-to places to eat"
Pulcinella,2,"The staff was very rude. When I asked what the dessert of the day was I got told rather harshly ""no, no, no, no dessert of the day today"" however wasn't overly fussed by that. I had the pizza which was very tasty and a cocktail. When we got the bill we kindly asked for the service charge to be removed where the waiter was confrontational when asking if we wanted it removed, snatched the receipt off of the table and crumpled it up in their hands, before stroming off to get a new receipt. Was an enjoyable experience up until that point."
The Anchor Line,5,Lovely restaurant in the centre of Glasgow. The staff were very attentive. We had a voucher from itison and it was brilliant. There were a good few things on the menu that could be made gluten free. Nice atmosphere and a lovely meal. Thank you!
The Anchor Line,5,Went here just after Christmas for some cocktails. Didn't have a booking but they still managed to find us a table. Really nice atmosphere and table service. Cocktails are really good with some classics and specials.
The Anchor Line,5,"Highly recommend, food was very nice and reasonable, cocktails were great, service was amazing, the decor and feel to the place really took you back to when it was the old booking office, very busy at the weekend so would book ahead. Reasonable prices"
The Anchor Line,5,"We popped in here while out a walk in town and it was absolutely stunning
Service is top class and as expected so was the drinks and oysters
Only wish we found it earlier on walk as we couldn't stay longer.
My first time trying oysters and loved them.
We will be back for cocktails and oysters very soon.
A great place in the heart of Glasgow"
The Anchor Line,5,The food and service were excellent. Def on my list of fave restaurants.
Tony Macaroni Glasgow City Centre,1,"At Tony Macaroni in downtown Glasgow, my experience was unfortunately far from satisfactory. I ordered mussels with garlic bread, largely because it seemed to be one of the few options that wasn't fried or akin to junk food. The presentation was disappointing: the mussels were crowded onto a small plate, with no side dish for the empty shells, rendering the meal mediocre at best.

On a slightly positive note, the dish was not overly salted, which I appreciated. However, the service left much to be desired. I requested hot water with lemon and was served cold water with a slice of lime instead. Overall, I can't say I'd recommend the experience."
Tony Macaroni Glasgow City Centre,3,"This was a lovely family dinner, meal & service were excellent but I think we'd booked on Teen night. There were numerous tables of kids likely aged 14-18 who were all very well behaved but as you'd expect, pretty noisy so it made it difficult for us to hear our own conversation at times. I'd maybe suggest cordoning off an area for these guys, I think it's great they have somewhere to go (and buy 2 starters between 8 üòÇ) but maybe creating a little divide would help everyone enjoy the space.

I do also have to mention that the toilets are dreadful and in serious need of a refurb, as is the carpet (which is sticky) in the stairwell to the toilets. But that can't be helped by the staff who were all fabulous."
Tony Macaroni Glasgow City Centre,4,"Food was enjoyable. Staff were very warm, friendly and helpful with choice of menu. Although we didn't get to eat any dessert because we were extremely full from having the starter platter and the main dish."
Tony Macaroni Glasgow City Centre,4,"If you're on a budget then this place is good enough.
We had pizza, carbonara pasta, calamari starter and white wine.
Wine was good, and the food wasn't too bad either.
Restaurant did seem not to be looked after, a little cluttered.
But otherwise okay experience."
Tony Macaroni Glasgow City Centre,5,We go here regularly for lunch and always have a great experience. All the food we've tried has been great and the staff are always really friendly and helpful.
O Sole Mio,5,"Lovely little Italian restaurant! Food was amazing and staff were very attentive and polite. Cocktails were good too. Would recommend the black ink spaghetti with the scallops,  absolutely delicious! Will definitely be back here next time I visit Glasgow!"
O Sole Mio,5,"Nice small authentic Italian, decent food. Pleasant service, happily recommend."
O Sole Mio,5,"Absolutely amazing, the prices are amazing considering the quality, the service, the atmosphere. It‚Äôs everything you could ever want from Glasgow, homely, friendly, kid friendly with lovely staff with amazing food! Making an effort to every week now. Thank you!"
O Sole Mio,4,"Just a walk in and was happily shown to our table. Staff front of house attentive, good options of menu,we had a lunch time special. Minestrone soup,and bruschetta starter, followed by lasagna,  and a chicken mushroom, veg and rustic chips."
O Sole Mio,4,"We were here for dinner on 30/01/2024.  Fabulous food in a lovely restaurant and the staff were polite and helpful.  I have unusual allergies but, there were no problems and I wasn't made to feel like I was a nuisance.  Definitely highly recommend this restaurant"
The Spanish Butcher,5,"Restaurant has a lovely interior. The food was delicious and the steak perfectly cooked. The smoked salmon starter was a bit bland and presentation was odd. The panacotta was really good though. The service was quite disappointing in comparison to the food, and not very attentive. Overall a good option for a special occasion."
The Spanish Butcher,5,"Take their lunch set menu: street corn is amazing! However, the rump steak is just okay - good but not that surprising. Almond tart is good also they have a good red wine from Rioja.

I will come back to try other types of steak :)"
The Spanish Butcher,5,"What a incredible experience from the moment we arrived (albeit the table wasn't ready but that's ok)
I believe our server was Stefano, this guy needs a raise! He had so much knowledge of the menu from the steaks and the flavours, sides, sauces and how the bone marrow is cooked.

He went above and beyond.
The steak for our party of 4 (one had a burger but was equally very happy with it!) Was cooked to perfection and how we asked for it.
Bone marrow for me was a let down, underwhelming but that's a personal preference as I'm not sure what flavour I expected.
Otherwise I highly recommend this place for a good steak and truffle fries.

Perhaps offer truffle fries with the burger too though? Think they miss out with the skinny fries instead!
Thank you Stefano for such a pleasant experience, just wish the tip went directly to him!

Pictured is the bone marrow and scotch fillet. Others had the galacian which they said was well worth the money."
The Spanish Butcher,5,"Great little restaurant and bar. We only stayed for a couple of cocktails and some oysters (which were top notch), but all the food looked incredible. Staff were very friendly as well.

The old fashioned with Pedro Xim√©nez sherry was incredible.

Can't wait to come back and try the food next time."
The Spanish Butcher,5,"The food was absolutely amazing and I will definitely be returning soon. If you're looking for outstanding food and impeccable service, this is the place to go."
Santa Lucia Merchant City Glasgow,5,"It was our first visit to Santa Lucia Merchant City and definitely won't be our last! The food was incredible! Everyone enjoyed every dish from starters, pastas, pizzas and desserts. The service was very friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is really lovely. We had a great dinner thank you!"
Santa Lucia Merchant City Glasgow,5,"There is something about this restaurant that feels very authentic Italian from looking outside to the minute you step in. It's refreshing. The decor is traditional and modern at the same time and the atmosphere is great. We all thoroughly enjoyed our food which was delicious and fairly priced. Our servers were all very friendly and fast, my only criticism was that sometimes it was difficult to get their attention as it was busy when we went. Otherwise though I would recommend this place"
Santa Lucia Merchant City Glasgow,4,"Dreamy romantic place with hues of blue, yellow and white tiles for that Tuscany feels! Great courteous staff:)

Pros: Reasonably priced. Decent taste. Bruschetta had an onion puree which I thought was a unique touch. Loved the Oreo Cheescake and Brownie with ice cream!

Cons: Limited vegetarian options. Not much scope for customization"
Santa Lucia Merchant City Glasgow,5,"Food was excellent & service was outstanding without being too intrusive. My OH's prawns tasted like they had come straight out of the ocean. 2 mains,2 drinks,coffees & a starter for ¬£65 these days is a bargain."
Santa Lucia Merchant City Glasgow,5,"Amazing restaurant!! Gorgeous cosy vibes & the staff were so friendly, in particular our Italian waiter a young gentleman who was so so attentive and kind. Food was delicious and they had a live singer who was just fabulous! To top it off the food was absolutely delicious, highly recommend!"
'BABS,4,"A modern gourmet kebab house right in the heart of Glasgow City Centre.
Friendly staff served the most delicious Greek/Turkish food, cooked to perfection. We had the special offer lunch menu for around  ¬£13 - choice of mains, fries and soft drink - great value.
We will definitely return!"
'BABS,5,"It was just walking distance from the hotel where we were staying in Glasgow, not only that but it also had a good review on Google. There was a pleasant atmosphere, and there was no problem ordering food by looking at the menu. But after we ordered, we just asked them if they had any special items, and then they recommended the Lamp Escander, it was the best dish of what we ordered. As I had to leave in the morning, I postponed my desire to go for another time."
'BABS,5,"Absolutely lovely restaurant, fully booked but made an effort to accommodate and got us a reservation to return in an hour (unlike multiple other restaurants that just turned us away)

Food was incredible, (having lived in Greece, it lived up to the standard!) staff were lovely, attentive and we also enjoyed some great, reasonably priced cocktails too!

We both enjoyed a chicken and halloumi souvlaki as well as a side of Ravasaki (Fried Feta in honey) then shared a delicious chocolate tort. So 2 cocktails, one starter, 2 mains a side and a pudding (and a tip) all came to ¬£61.50 which we thought was very reasonable.

Highly recommend"
'BABS,5,"The food quality was great. It came in quickly but the portion was relatively small especially the burger.

Friendly staff and beautiful setting."
'BABS,5,They were nice enough to let us have a table that was reserved in an hour from the time we arrived. I liked my gyros. My friend likes his lamb (cooked perfectly as he asked).
Taste of Chennai Glasgow,5,Visited here on Valentines Day. I was well served. The taste of the dishes were very authentic and excellent. I would definitely recommend this place if you wanted to try real south Indian style food
Taste of Chennai Glasgow,5,"Food was authentic Indian. Dosa and chutney made me feel I am right in India.
Lemon rice, curd rice, were to the point. Enough quantity for the cost you pay. Brilliant taste. Like India. Service is good.

Pepper chicken, chicken biryani were average . Parking is difficult."
Taste of Chennai Glasgow,3,"Our first visit here for lunch. Nice decor and friendly service.

We ordered lamb bhuna, prawn madras, pratha, dosa and tri rice and pot of tea and glass of luke warm water.  I wanted my prawns cook with coconut milk instead of tomato based.  The chef came to our table to find out how I would like my prawns madras spicy or mild?  I said medium spicy. He said he will make it special for me. It was good. My friend loves her lamb bhuna.

The owner and the chef are very friendly. The owner came to our table and had a wee chat with us. He asked us how was the food? And the chef asked how was my prawns madras? Well, as you can see from the pictures below.  We demolished it.  We will come back again."
Taste of Chennai Glasgow,5,One of the best South Indian restaurant in UK. Food was extremely tasty that worth the price. Staffs were polite and attentive. Thank you for such great service.
Taste of Chennai Glasgow,3,"Food is strictly okay. Staff is friendly. We had quite a variety of dishes here and weren't particularly delighted with the flavours. That said, we did enjoy the Indian filter coffee and would recommend that if you're a coffee lover."
Cafe Andaluz,3,"We went for Valentine's Day dinner and this is our first time here. For a 3 course meal, we had bread and olives which was really good with a variety of bread offered. We ordered 5 tapas - out of which the prawns were the best. The baked aubergine and lamb were good too. The food was delicious with sangria. Finally, we had a brownie for dessert, so yummy but the sorbet was so bad that we couldn't have more than a bite."
Cafe Andaluz,5,"Everything was great! Whatever you order you‚Äôll know will be good, we did a bit of everything: Patatas Bravas, Croquetas de Jam√≥n y Queso, different chicken and lamb options, 10/10 ‚≠êÔ∏è The service was also great, the dishes came out quickly one after the other."
Cafe Andaluz,5,Went here with a friend a wee while ago and it was so good! I‚Äôve been to Cafe Andaluz in Edinburgh and this one is way better. The staff were amazing and attentive and the food was delicious. The decorations were really nice and it was nice and quiet when we went. I highly recommend going here if you‚Äôre looking for good Spanish food and tapas!!
Cafe Andaluz,4,"Another anniversary dinner with my lovely wife. This is the first time we have visited the west end restaurant as we normally book with the one near George square. Food was good, a few things were amiss with the meatballs as the individual balls were tough. But other than that a great atmosphere with all the Spanish touches surrounding us. The service was great with the only nip pick was we had to constantly try and find out waiter for drinks. He seamed to be fully concentrating on the larger tables."
Cafe Andaluz,4,Food was good and very well priced! Must say that I was a tiny bit disappointed by the paella but it was still good. Great service and atmosphere and the restaurant looks absolutely lovely.
Mediterraneo Italian Restaurant & Champagne Bar,5,"Booked the private room for a smallish wedding 40+ guests.

Nuncio, Anna, and every single one of the staff made it so easy for us. They could not do enough. Real old style Italian hospitality. The food as usual was excellent. Always 5 stars.

I would recommend this Mediterraneo in a heartbeat for everything from a simple romantic meal to a small conference in the private area.

Thank you everyone for making a special occasion very special. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Mediterraneo Italian Restaurant & Champagne Bar,5,"Popped in by chance and would be back. 100% recommend, service was quick and all of the staff were wonderful. Food was excellent and very reasonably priced. Surprised by size of side dish as shown in photo."
Mediterraneo Italian Restaurant & Champagne Bar,5,"Very nice place. The food was quite good. I had the beef tagliatelle and the burrata with tomato starter. The starter was fresh and lovely. Mains was good too. And service was also quite good. All in all, happy with the whole package."
Mediterraneo Italian Restaurant & Champagne Bar,5,I ate here with a bunch of friends for my partners friends' 40th. Food was delicious and our waiter was lovely. Me & my partner shared the chateaubriand it was 10/10.
Mediterraneo Italian Restaurant & Champagne Bar,5,"Food was good, they have a lunch menu too."
La Bonne Auberge,5,"Absolutely AMAZING food, could not even fault it. Cocktails... Well they could have been done better, but you work with what you got. Service lovely. But the food and style were just astounding. Well done to the chefs. Cause the food was bloody fab."
La Bonne Auberge,5,Lovely Christmas menu with hot food and hot plates.  A real difficulty is selection from a number of tempting sounding dishes.  Mist have a twist on the ordinary which makes a repeat visit a near necessity before the festive season ends.
La Bonne Auberge,2,"It‚Äôs an ok place with decent staff, if somewhat lacking in atmosphere. They don‚Äôt sell any Scottish beer or lager though - as a matter of policy. Just another foreign multiple. They won‚Äôt get my custom again."
La Bonne Auberge,5,"Nice restaurant; booked a table during the week for the 2/3 course special. The selections were great and the food was awesome. The staff there were also very patient, as we had a somewhat late booking. I got some minced steak as my main and creme Brule as dessert, can't exactly remember what my friend ordered but I've inserted a photo. I'd definitely recommend the place."
La Bonne Auberge,4,"The food was awesome as we ate there for 5 nights in a row. The Soup of the day, Haggis croquettes, Sunday roast, Braised beef, Chicken schnitzel, Beer battered haddock, LBA beef burger and their warm sticky toffee pudding was to die for. The negative about this place is that if you get there around 8pm then the staff tell you that they are expecting a large party and then try to deter you from eating there or tell you point blank that they cannot accommodate you even though the restaurant is mostly empty. We were staying at their hotel, so they had no choice but to give us a table, but this occurred every night with different staff. And every night, we noticed that their large party never materialized so I assume they do it on purpose so that they can clean up and go home early rather than have to deal with customer past 8pm."
Brel,3,"Bring blankets, but not your appetite! Dined here for the new Sunday roast for two, but literally had to ask the server if another plate was coming. The temp inside was Baltic, but they did provide blankets -- and the fondue gravy also provided have warmth. The portion was small, and the meat cool, and it tasted like the potatoes had been cooked from frozen."
Brel,4,"Gorgeous interior giving off a European pub and beer garden vibe, with indoor and outdoor seating. The interior was cozy. We went on Tuesday and it was a fondue and raclette night! Was fun to self-prep the cheese. The fondue was okay to share between 2 people. It was a good experience but the platter was quite basic. The service was average, very friendly but I think they were a bit stretched in staffing."
Brel,5,"Went to Brel for a birthday meal and had a great time. Seated in the terrace and although the weather was not the best the heaters, food & atmosphere made up for this. Kids loved it and Coco had a great time as well."
Brel,4,"Food and drink were good as I expected.
But the outside space was too cold due to wind, there was no heater and no more blanket."
Brel,4,Great atmosphere.  Was a little cramped getting to & from our table based on how others were seated.  Meatballs were okay.  Chocolate fondue was so yummy!  Visit after dark as the lights are beautiful.
Gaucho Glasgow,5,"All 5 of us had a wonderful dining experience tonight.
All the staff were exceptional but a special shout out for Olivia, who did most of the service for our table.
The food was exceptional and all staff well briefed on the menu options."
Gaucho Glasgow,4,"We love meat!
So we came hear with expectations. Unfortunately, one of steaks we ordered (raw) was more like medium rare. But the service immediately reacted and gave us a 50% discount at the end. Unexpected but very positive indeed.
The interior is just amazing. High class location.
Coming from Germany, having a glass of wine for 20 pound is, say, something not very common but it was really worth it. So, listen to the recommendations you‚Äôll get.
All in all it was a great time we had at the Gaucho. Thank you, Sam!"
Gaucho Glasgow,5,"Came here for two special occasions -- birthday and anniversary -- and both meals were spectacular. The steak is among the best in Glasgow, and the appetizers and cocktails simply elevate the experience to an entirely other level. Definitely try the truffle arancini!"
Gaucho Glasgow,5,Fantastic quality food and a must try. The mushrooms are absolutely incredible as a side to your steak. My steak was cooked medium and was exactly how I asked it to be cooked. The atmosphere was also fantastic and a high-end feel to the place. Would certainly recommend to anyone who wanted a nice romantic meal out!
Gaucho Glasgow,5,"Went for a weekend lunch for two. Service was amazing, the menu was well explained and our server was helpful, attentive and super friendly. The food was great, the sea bass tartare was my favourite and the steak was cooked perfectly and I recommend the roast vegetables side to go with.
The best part has to be the decor and interior, impeccable attention to detail makes the experience feel luxury even in the middle of a cold rainy Sunday."
Browns Glasgow,5,"Visited on Sunday and had the sliced sirloin roast, I was really impressed! The meat was so tender and tasty üëåüèª beautiful presentation and the veg was delicious too. Service was also friendly and quick would definitely recommend."
Browns Glasgow,4,"I went to Browns with my Partner for Christmas Eve dinner (which is kind important for us because of the culture factor) and we took Festive üéÑ 3 courses menu üçΩÔ∏è with drinks üçπ

First we place the order for drinks and we went with Negroni (which was sadly out of stock) so as alternative replacement was recommendation (from very professional and super kind 'Romanian' waiter) to try Old Fashioned cocktail instead. Which was not really close to Negroni but for Scottish Whiskey Experience fine enough üòä
Cask - Belheaven - local beer was really good üëç

For Starter I took Smoked Salmon (again Scottish üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åøü´∂) with Horseradish Cr√®me Fraiche, capers and toasted ciabatta. Which was a fair introduction to the Main dish.

Braised blade of beef üçñwith mashed, quite sophisticated selection of veg and black garlic sauce was very tasty and meat was incredibly tender

And for the dessert I get classical Christmas Pudding üçÆwith Brandy butter which was alright but a bit to dry.

Of some reason we didn't get our Finish what supposed to be Cheese üßÄ Selection ü§∑

Generally quite pleasant dinner we had but we both agree that portions have been a bit to small and there wasn't much to be surprised of the textures or ingredients.
For ¬£38 without a drink it was still one of the cheapest Festive Menus option in central Glasgow but we guess it was a slightly disappointing.
In TOTAL we have paid almost ¬£125 and that's a lot in our opinion.

No matter what it was pretty nice evening after all (with a bit of thrill üí£ when we received by mistake not our bill for ¬£260üòÖ)
So we had a joyful time."
Browns Glasgow,3,"1 main returned twice - items cold
1 main returned - main element cool
1 dessert tasted like a stale donut and luke warm
1 christmas pudding cold and tasted like it was uncooked from refridgerator.

Staff dealt very professionally, removed automatic charged 10% gratuity, which is a poor practice for a table of 3, and we were not charged for desserts."
Browns Glasgow,5,"the geezer serving us was a gent, we were hungover to bits but this place looked after us, lobster ü¶û Benedict and traditional breakfast were top class, mouth watering food to finish it ff a lovely trip to G-town, Rise up Glasgow, can‚Äôt wait to return! So reasonably priced too, Happy new year to the staff!"
Browns Glasgow,4,The food was delish! Our group had several of the dishes and all were good. Only item to improve was the pastry on the veggie Wellington was a little over-done.
Zizzi - Glasgow Princes Square,4,"The food was good and arrived in good time .
The service was lacking a little. Our server seemed annoyed to be there.
The atmosphere was non-existent, but it's an odd location, so not much they can do about that.
Not the most comfortable seats.
We know zizzi food will be consistent, and for a quick after work bite, it was fine"
Zizzi - Glasgow Princes Square,2,"Had dinner here last evening on the way to the cinema.
My wife had a lovely pizza I ordered Spaghetti Bolognaise.
I have eaten Spaghetti Bolognaise many a time and never had a problem.
Zizzi say on their menu ‚Äú our take on a crowd favourite, with a beef & tomato Ragu‚Äù
The Bolognaise description on Google. ‚ÄúSpaghetti tossed in a sauce made from tomatoes, minced beef, garlic, wine, herbs, and spices‚Äù.
Look at the first photo and see what I ended up with. A bowl of SPAGHETTI coated in olive oil. No taste of garlic, tomato and hardly any BEEF.
All for the pricely sum of ¬£13.75.
Very poor.
I‚Äôve added a couple of other photos of what I would expect when I order a Spag Bol.
Hint, hint Zizzi."
Zizzi - Glasgow Princes Square,4,"Popped in for a bite to eat , staff were friendly and helpful.  Issue with ice machine , but nothing major. Also given wrong bill but that‚Äôs an easy mistake.  Food was fantastic."
Zizzi - Glasgow Princes Square,5,Fantastic wee birthday dinner for my partner.  Staff where helpful and friendly and yes here I go üöª toilets clean and fresh
Zizzi - Glasgow Princes Square,4,"At Zizzi, the food was delicious and the price was reasonable. Sweet potato fries were okay. Margarita pizza was good. The risotto was a bit salty."
Meat Joint Scottish Steakhouse,5,"Me & my wife don‚Äôt get out much for dinner so when we do it‚Äôs so important to us that we select the right place.

Honestly this may have been one the the single greatest meals I‚Äôve had in my life time.

Apon arriving I felt the restaurant was small and was slightly concerned with the table size.

The staff made the experience feel intimate without being intimidating.

The food, WOW. I opted for the scotch egg and sirloin and my wife went for the soup (parsnip and lemon) & filet.

Both of us after each bite shared a look of joy and can honestly say this was the greatest steak I have had in a long time.

After a toilet break I was smiling from ear to ear because instead of the usual elevator music the toilets had a tape of Scottish comedian Kevin bridges playing, I felt this was a very nice touch as not only did it make the toilet break a fun time but it was a nod to Glaswegian culture in a restaurant that initially felt it was taking its self to seriously this help to set the atmosphere as a place that takes the food and customer experience seriously but maybe not its self.

My only feed back was the lack of a cocktail menu on the drinks sections, I would have loved to have washed this down with a negroni, I‚Äôm sure if I asked they would have helped but without a clear cocktail menu I was apprehensive

We will be back."
Meat Joint Scottish Steakhouse,5,"Lovely little restaurant, perfect ambiance, delicious wine and food. I started off with the tomato & carrot soup which was delicious and for the main dish I had the Sirloin steak. Really enjoyed the gravy that came with it. If I ever make it back to Glasgow I will dine here again!!"
Meat Joint Scottish Steakhouse,2,"We received a gift voucher for here and were so excited to try it based on the reviews.

Unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed. Both of our steaks were so bland; it was unbelievable. There were some parts which were and therefore those parts couldn‚Äôt be eaten. The peppercorn sauce was watery and the mushrooms were inedible.

The chips were nice but when you are spending this kind of money on a steak, there is a standard that should be met.

We have been to many steak places and therefore we had high hopes for here.

I was so disappointed by the dinner that I didn‚Äôt order a dessert because I didn‚Äôt want to spend any more money. We promptly asked for the bill after the mains.

It‚Äôs such a shame because the service was good.
The 10% service charge is automatically added here which is something that wasn‚Äôt mentioned to us.

Some people were very casually dressed which we didn‚Äôt like either.

We wouldn‚Äôt recommend this restaurant and have shared this with all of our friends and family. There are plenty of other alternatives which won‚Äôt leave you disappointed."
Meat Joint Scottish Steakhouse,5,Such a lovely steak house! Food was amazing and service was above and beyond. Would highly recommend!!
Meat Joint Scottish Steakhouse,5,"Read the good reviews and booked.

Good welcome and service.

Decided to skip starters and we knew the meat portions are large.

Amazing cote de boeuf. Really was a massive piece with a big bone with amazing chips and small salad with one mushroom ( reminded me of an English breakfast) .

Meat was amazingly done. Medium rare.

Negroni was good just felt overpriced for Glasgow."
Nanakusa,4,"I loved the sushi here, it is absolutely delicious!! Alongside the takoyaki & the Katsu curry. Generous portion sizes. A little bit lacking in atmosphere when you go inside, no music, and a bit cold. However, the food is great so you don‚Äôt mind it too much! It was empty, and it definitely shouldn‚Äôt be with the good quality of sushi on offer there!! I‚Äôll be back to try more on their menu üëèüèª"
Nanakusa,5,"Great bento box option here!

The special bento box is such a great surprise, it came in such a huge portion with nigiri, maki, ebi tempura and chicken teriyaki!
The chicken teriyaki is soo good,  genuinely  surprised by that, it‚Äôs slightly crispy and I loved it!

The sushi were great and gyu don is my friend‚Äôs favourite, so if you like beef and onions go give it a try!

Plenty of seating inside and a variety of things from the menu you can choose from. Great price for the portions. Great service from Kenny. Would recommend this place to Japanese food lovers!"
Nanakusa,5,"Haven‚Äôt been here in years and had a spur of inspiration to return recently as we were attending the theatre nearby. The food was absolutely gorgeous, I can‚Äôt recommend it enough. We had a starter and a main each and we left very happy, will definitely be back!"
Nanakusa,5,"Easily the best Japanese food in the city center, and value for money.

They provide gigantic portions which I struggled to finish, and the food tastes excellent üëå

Reminded me a lot when I was back in Japan. Atmosphere was nice and quiet, they deserve more customers but they're far out.

Highly recommend you trek out to visit this place!"
Nanakusa,5,Best sushi in Glasgow. Prices are excellent and staff are wonderful and very accommodating and welcoming. Can't recommend the food enough. Our daughter doesn't usually eat sushi but loves the food here. Best in Scotland by far!
The Italian Kitchen,4,"Nice Saturday afternoon for lunch and catch up with family. I would advise booking as was very busy. Great extensive menu, lovely atmosphere inside, our waitress was lovely, friendly and efficient. Now to the food :) I had the stuffed pepper that was lovely although I felt could have been cooked that wee bit longer. The pasta was ok, although over cooked. I would go back and try something different.  Reasonable priced and coffee (flat white) was OK if a little strong"
The Italian Kitchen,5,Really special night. We booked in advance for a table for 19 to feed our wedding guest. We just wanted a nice relaxing meal after a small cosy wedding. This place was perfect we have eaten here before and the food was fab! They served up a set menu which had something for everyone (menu 2) I think it was very reasonably priced and a perfect way to end our celebrations. The server were excellent my guest were never without a drink and there was nice spaces between course. Really great day to end our day so glad we picked this place.
The Italian Kitchen,4,"I really liked this place. The servers were great and one of them was very funny, which is always nice. The pasta was very tasty. However, the pasta was a bit overcooked, which was a bit disappointing.

My pizza was the star of the show, though. It was easily one the best and most tasty pizzas I've had in Glasgow. Using that oven definitely makes a difference. The bottom was crispy without being burnt, and the toppings were generously added on.

The waiter didn't use a notepad and forgot one of the items from the order. It's all fine and well if you can remember everything, but if not, it's not best to just jot it down.

The decor and overall atmosphere of The Italian Kitchen was top tier. Overall, this place would be ideal for a date or family meal. Highly recommend."
The Italian Kitchen,4,"Good place for a relaxing meal, which tastes good and served timely.
The staff are nice , though if the place is busy they can be a bit distracted and disregard signs from customers clear as daylight.
The pizza is ok, ours was fine but we had a bit of flex in the pasta base. I would not go for specifically for the pizza here and they have no other base than tomato base.
Many places near by has other base at least a few.
The chips is great and the pumpkin soup was delicious. The squid could be better, as a starter that was a bit rough.
Coke was a bit strange, not sure which type was it. Otherwise clean and tidy place but a bit crammed and no option to have a pram at your table which makes a bit complicated for families with little one."
The Italian Kitchen,5,Delicious Italian food for a good price. The gamberoni pasta was delicious and we liked the service too. Perfect for a nice occasion
Ristorante Pieno,5,"The large amount of people eating here are people who are about to go to the theatre next door. We discovered this as when we arrived the place was packed and within 30 minutes it was just us and another table left as the show was starting and everyone left. Good to keep in mind that the busyness  of this restaurant is tightly coupled to the theatre shows. The food is great, as is the service and the prices are decent - all certainly above the other Italian chains in the area. Overall a good experience and we'll be back."
Ristorante Pieno,3,"I'll be honest I was disappointed. The prawn cocktail was not very fresh. The prawns were very hard and the salad was limp, the sauce was watery. My main was better, the sauce was nice but then the chicken was rubbery. The salad again wasn't too fresh - but I was hungry and had nothing much to eat that day. My daughter had a better meal, her mozzarella sticks were tasty and the pizza was nice. The staff were lovely though. I did feel it was a bit expensive for what we got, but then it's the city centre."
Ristorante Pieno,5,1st visit this evening for dinner 10/2/24. Food was delicious and great service. The restaurant was buzzing. As a disabled customer (who generally doesn't  like busy places) I felt really welcome and safe. Good selections of cocktails too.  Thankyou we will be back soon. Would recommend :)
Ristorante Pieno,5,"Simpliy delicious food. I was not a fan of Italian food back in Canada, regardless of high-end or casual restaurant. Then I realized I simply hadn't had the real Italian food until now. Their cappuccino also redefined my understanding of coffee, the foam floats on top and doesn't shrink at all. The balance between milk and expresso is perfect"
Ristorante Pieno,5,"Very friendly and very fast service with fantastic tasting food. Great inside, everything was clean and well maintained. Nothing to fault.

Had 2 pizzas, both came quickly and hot. Crispy bases so you need to eat them fast.

Staff were very friendly and attentive.

Can‚Äôt say enough about what a nice restaurant it was. Will definitely go again when I am in the area."
iasg,1,"RUDE. RUDE. RUDE bar staff and bartender. Friend came from Ireland so took her to a ""top"" hotel with a lovely bar... and that's where it stopped.
Bartender didn't even crack a smile. Was indifferent and bored. Wouldn't make the drink we wanted. Reluctantly made the drinks on the menu, which cost 14 quid each.
Bad experience and horrible service!"
iasg,5,"Celebrated my graduation here with my family and close friends. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the food was delicious and they even gave us a complimentary glass of Prosecco each for the special occasion! Would definitely come back and recommend eating here."
iasg,4,We had booked a 2 course champagne lunch (to use a voucher) only to be told they only served brunch on a Sunday - this was not made clear when I booked. One of the party was vegetarian (advised at the time of booking) and very little choice on the brunch menu for vegetarians although they did adapt a couple of dishes. Not sure we got the value of the voucher due to 'brunch type' dishes - poor dessert selection - again because this was a brunch menu and not a lunch menu
iasg,4,"My partner took us here for our Anniversary dinner, it‚Äôs beautiful inside. I ordered the soup as a starter which was fine, nothing special in my opinion. The burger was lovely but don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the ¬£15. Chocolate mousse was very nice. Staff were lovely, gave us both a glass of free champagne as it was a special occasion. Overall it was a lovely restaurant, maybe a little overpriced for some items on the menu but wasn‚Äôt too crazy."
iasg,5,"Lovely space. Had to wait awhile for anyone to acknowledge us when we walked into the hotel. The drinks menu could have more on it. Still would come back again ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Update: Went back for a dinner and it was lovely. Very nice waiter and the food was amazing."
Wee Paree,4,"Really cute and cozy caf√©/bar/restaurant with great atmosphere! The staff was really nice too, we arrived late and they kept our table. Food was great, with also GF options. Only note is the price of dessert ¬£9 for the brownies which were good but a bit overpriced I think."
Wee Paree,5,"Absolutely wonderful! From the food to the service, everything was incredible. I highly recommend the french toast, the portion size justifies the price. The service was attentive and polite (without being overbearing), and the food came out relatively quickly. They also have a range of mocktails which are delicious.

My only criticism would be that the mocktails are expensive considering there's no alcohol and the door doesn't fully close so it can get chilly if you're sat close to it."
Wee Paree,5,"We love this wee place~~ the best crepes we‚Äôve ever had in Scotland! And the melting baked Camembert was so attempting!

Heart warming services and excellent food! Definitely will visit again."
Wee Paree,5,We travelled from Edinburgh to Glasgow to celebrate üçæ Valentine's day ‚ù§Ô∏è . My husband did it as a surprise.  Wee Paree never fail us with their food and service.  We miss the sharing meals though.  It's not on offer at the moment.  But their French food menu tops all the time.  Well the patrons speaks for itself all the time.  Resto is always packed.
Wee Paree,5,"A lovely atmospheric little local restaurant - excellent spot for brunch and good coffee, and great kind and thoughtful staff. While they don't have a specific kids menu they kindly made up a child's portion on request, resulting in the cutest serving of mini pancakes, bacon and maple syrup I've ever seen!"
La Vita,4,"Italian food with lots of options.
Got the garlic bread for starter but they‚Äôre a bit burnt but still nice, also got calamari, which wasn‚Äôt fried enough for our liking, the haggis arancini didn‚Äôt have much flavour.

The tagliatelle calabrese is very nice lots of sauce and sausage, very flavourful! I really recommend this! My friend had the Quattro stagioni which she found alright. I love how you can get half pasta here, very accommodating.

For dessert I had the chocolate covered strawberry tart. The tart is quite dense, is massive portion, I had a lot of whip cream in the middle. My friend got the cheese cake which looking amazing but she found it too sweet.

Tried the festive cocktail merry kiss mas, it was very sweet, if you have a sweet tooth it‚Äôs be perfect for you. The clausmopolitan is nice. I love the cocktail menu here, you have so many options to choose from.

The menu is big with good varieties. There‚Äôs plenty of seatings but not much leg room upstairs, the corridors are narrow, the decor is very festive, Craig who served us is great!"
La Vita,5,I enjoyed my experience here. The food was 10/10 so good so yummy. The staff are AH-mazing! So friendly and so helpful. Would definitely recommend and would definitely come back.
La Vita,1,"some staffs are nice but some are being cool I dont know whyÔºåmy pasta is super less flavor and the chicken inside is hard as stone.

La Vita,5,""" Life is Beautiful "" @ La Vita as are the meals and service. They handle the larger demands at this busy time of the year effortlessly.
Their traditional italian meals are exceptional but you`ve got to try their traditional scottish breakfast : )"
La Vita,4,"I came here to have breakfast and loved the food. We came here after walking a lot to find a place to get some classy breakfast, and it was definitely worth it. The waiters were very friendly and the food arrived pretty quickly. Next time I will be here to get some nice lunch or dinner."
Ashoka Ashton Lane,3,"I tried their prawn masala with biryani rice and fish pakora, and 2 cups of tea. Portion is generous, I order one meal for two person. Service is also good."
Ashoka Ashton Lane,3,"We were somewhat disappointed with the standard of most of the food. While naans were hot, crisp and generously sized a dish of Chole was rancid. Lamb biryani was satisfactory as was a lamb curry. Everything was over spiced and too salty - an old trick intended to drive drink sales. Service was friendly and attentive though, which was nice."
Ashoka Ashton Lane,5,"Amazing plentiful presentation of food in a beautiful restaurant on a beautiful street. Excellent service as well. Highly recommend the juicy Dosas and the haggis pakoras as starters. The mains are waaaaaay bigger than I‚Äôm used to getting  - I would say one serves two. So get two and take home leftovers! The Lamb sharab masti was especially delicious. The naans are also waaaaaay bigger than I‚Äôm used to and also way more flavorful and expertly baked. The garlic naan certainly doesn‚Äôt skimp on the garlic and the sweeter peshwari naan quickly became the highlight of the table. The table behind us ordered what I believe is the giant naan and if you‚Äôre going to try to impress somebody ‚Ä¶ order that. Excellent and unusual presentation! Many thanks to our server, Diksh, who was beyond hospitable and informative."
Ashoka Ashton Lane,5,"The staff were so attentive,  present ,but not pushy.  The cleanliness of the restaurant and the toilets just added to the experience. The assurance from the staff on the food choices reassured you of your choice. Good portions and quality throughout."
Ashoka Ashton Lane,5,"First visit in a long time,one of Glasgow West ends most enduring asian restaurants .
Tasty  pakora, unusually served in a metal cage for starters.  My friend and i both had delicious Patia dishes. The tangy sauce tasting exactly  like a patia should .This was accompanied  by excellent  Garlic Nan and fried Rice. The bill for two was ¬£45. The decor is how it should be, traditional  with beautiful  wall murals. Staff were very attentive and friendly. Situated in the  historic Ashton lane, very close to Hillhead Underground. This is a dining experience  worth seeking out."
Mezcal,3,"Service was poor. Upon arrival and during our visit, the staff were not welcoming. My wife spoke to a member of staff when we arrived. The staff member walked away when my wife was still talking to ask her question. so rude!

However we've heard great things about the food. The kitchen clearly doing a great job as the food was excellent.
we had the Taquitos and Luch Libre chicken burrito.

we also had a mountain of Tortilla chips with not enough guacamole.

cocktails very over priced."
Mezcal,5,We went in for food with my friend and the food was absolutely delicious. The prices were reasonably good and drinks were so nice. The place was also stunningly. Definitely will visit again soon.
Mezcal,3,"This was an itison deal. The frozen margaritas were delicious in particular the lime. The guacamole was decent but there wasn't enough of it for all the nachos. The loaded fries were cracking. Loved them! The birria had a great flavour but the meat was a bit chewy. The carne asada was as I expected, good flavour & texture. Tacos did fall apart somewhat as others have said. Staff were a bit hit & miss. Didn't offer the ice cream which was supposed to be included as a dessert option. The churros were unfortunately a disaster, very oily & greasy which is not how they are supposed to be. With a few tweaks this place could be great though. It definitely got the right sort of colourful Mexican vibe. It was Friday, the 18th of August from just before 5pm."
Mezcal,5,"Absolutely 10/10. Service, atmosphere and taste. Number one Mexican in Glasgow"
Mezcal,4,"A great wee dinner stop, with friendly service. Have the home made guacamole and tortilla chips whilst you're waiting for your meal to arrive.
Our mains were a decent size, full of great ingredients. I'd recommend using all the sauces to add some 'ooomph'. The frozen Margherita was lush, and whilst the beers are small (schooner size), water is provided at the table.
I'll be back to try the loaded fries. They looked too big as a side for one, but enough for two to share."
Roy√¢,5,"Really tasty Middle Eastern food, exactly what Glasgow has been missing. So tasty and portion sizes are very fair. Price wise it‚Äôs reasonable and the service was attentive and friendly. Ideal for vegetarians too."
Roy√¢,4,"Great place for Lebanese food. Lovely ambiance to sit in.

Came for a late lunch with a large party. Service was excellent and food is mostly good. Some of the flavours are a bit strange for Lebanese food and don't go together but overall everything was good.

Service was excellent and staff were courteous, polite and rapid.

Accommodated a pram with no fuss. Only issue is there are a few large steps leading up so you may need a hand to get a pram/ push chair up and in.

Food is halal and there is also a good selection mocktails. Not that much veggie options tbh.

As always I will give it a second try and then see if it is any difference."
Roy√¢,3,"Was really looking forward to coming here as the reviews were amazing so we finally booked for our anniversary‚Ä¶

I‚Äôll start by giving the benefit of the doubt that we came just on a bad night but we were basically ignored from the moment we got in the door. We were sat in the corner and it took 20 minutes to take our drinks/food order.

Our food came before our drinks even though we only ordered a beer and a wine, the food was okay but VERY PRICEY.

The prawns, lamb and dipping platter were really nice but the octopus omg.
¬£16 for what is shown in the picture was a literal joke, we actually showed our friends & family the next day how pathetic it was because it was laughable.

We waited so long for the potato‚Äôs to come that we didn‚Äôt even want them anymore but the sauce tasted sour for some reason? We didn‚Äôt complain mainly because getting someone‚Äôs attention was near impossible‚Ä¶

Staff were VERY friendly but a staff member was upset in the bathroom to which I hope she was okay!

Might visit again for drinks or something but not in the near future. Like I said, maybe we just came in on a bad night!"
Roy√¢,5,"Stylish restaurant serving great food a short distance from the city centre. Really enjoyed  the tapas options, the only slight disappointment being the octopus leg. This dish was a bit small and over charred for the price. Staff are very friendly and attentative, food is served 'when ready', which was actually a bit too fast, but not an issue."
Roy√¢,5,"Fabulous food, especially the prawns. Gorgeous wine, we had the Lebanese Chardonnay. Brilliant cocktails too. Perfect place for celebrating my birthday, and will be back many times before the next one."
Ralph & Finns,5,Excellent food and wines. We had a wonderful evening with friends. My scallops and the chicken Kiev were very delicious and went well with a glass of ros√©. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Thank you! Would like to come back during the next trip to Glasgow.
Ralph & Finns,5,"It's been on our list to try... and we really enjoyed it. We ate using the 5pm market menu (2 courses for ¬£18). I had the cauliflower cheese and my partner had the chicken Kiev. For dessert we had sticky toffee pudding and creme brulee. Everything was really good and the service was great to be honest. Friendly, welcoming staff."
Ralph & Finns,5,Great food and service. Decor inside is lovely
Ralph & Finns,4,"My partner and I decided to dine here for valentines day.we opted for the valentines set menu, which was reasonably priced at ¬£50 per head. The starter of the scallops was amazing!Steak was a tad underdone for what we asked (med rare), and we had to send it back. It came back out promptly, and we enjoyed the rest of our meal.

This place gives off Ivy vibes, very much the same in decor and dishes

8/10

Would definitely come back"
Ralph & Finns,5,"Great drinks & NA cocktails, interesting new menu, and tiramisu was big but delicious (shared)."
