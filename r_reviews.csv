"My husband and I were wowed by our experience at number 16. It was our last meal of our honeymoon, and we wanted a really good dinner. I cannot say enough about this restaurant. The food was exquisite. Everything from the soup to the entrees, to the incredible lemon dessert thing! The service was excellent too! I wish I could remember our servers name. He was super tall with reddish hair. 20 some thing.

I think one of the best references we can give is that we were sitting next to a party who were locals. Will locals as in three hours from the restaurant. They said that they never miss coming to the restaurant every time they‚Äôre in town. The next time we are in Glasgow, we will definitely make it back!"
"A great find thanks to the Michelin Guide, where Number 16 very much deserves to be. Lovely little place with very friendly staff, really delicious food (the cured sea bass to start was absolutely exceptional). Really glad to have found this place: highly recommend."
"We discovered this wonderful restaurant today. We ate duck leg terrine, cured salmon, venison ragu, pork belly & coconut parfait. Every dish was perfectly balanced and totally delicious. This small, but perfectly formed restaurant, is a must visit! Great service & lovely intimate atmosphere."
"Yesterday I had a professional dinner at this restaurant with one of my colleagues and a guest we had from Netherlands. The food was ‚ÄúEXCEPTIONAL‚Äù. Wonderful tasty dishes! Honestly, one of the most tasty food I have tried at Glasgow. Unfortunately, the service that we enjoyed was below our expectations! The persons who work there were smiley and very friendly but three times made us feel uncomfortable. First, even though we went there early at 5.30 and the restaurant had no other customers besides us, one of the three main dishes they brought us was wrong. It was the order of our guest from Netherlands. The food was very tasty as mentioned before and we didn‚Äôt really complain about that. Second, when we ordered our deserts the waitress brought us the bill at the same time without having asked about the bill (maybe the waitress was thinking that we will not like to have an espresso). We also didn‚Äôt pay so much attention about that, mainly because we were so happy with the food. Finally, when we had almost finished our deserts and paid, and while we were discussing with our guest, the waitress without asking she brought us our jackets!!! This last one made all of us feel very weird. It was like ‚Äúyou ate, you paid, go out to continue your discussion‚Äù. Again to be honest, this broke our good feelings from the wonderful food we enjoyed. So, very good food, associated with not very professional behavior from the persons who work there. Sometimes the small details play very important role on the satisfaction level that a customer receives from a restaurant!"
"Out for our anniversary dinner..
We both agreed that this was probably the best food we have had in the Glasgow area.

The food was exceptional and the service matched the food..
Great little restaurant with reasonably priced delicious food.. We will definitely be back.."
"One of the best restaurants in town, in fact I came down twice for lunch in between my conference talks over the past week. I would describe it as modern European cuisine in tapas style plates. Desserts (I had the semifreddo and that deconstructed affogato) are thoughtful and well executed."
"This review is long overdue. We went to Ox and Finch back in 2022, but I completely forgot to post a review. Fast forward to 2024 and my wife and I are still raving about our meal here. Excellent meal with great service. One of the best meals we've had in all of the UK."
"We went for dinner yesterday, the staff was amazing, the restaurant was cozy and nice, the food was amazing and our waitress lovely, she even prepared this little surprise even we had not asked for it. We recommend the sea trout and lamb! One of the best meals I‚Äôve had in the UK, so if you‚Äôre in Glasgow, book a table and enjoy."
"It‚Äôs overrated. Still, I would recommend it to a friend. We ordered duck salad, cod cheeks, rump fillet, lamb shoulder and warm ginger cake. Duck salad and rump fillet were tasty. Ginger cake was a bit too sweet for my taste. A hit and a miss I would say."
"We ordered 8 dishes in total (3 people) and everything was very well-seasoned and delicious! ü§§
Highly recommend the lamb shoulders, üêë buffalo mozzarella with kale, cod cheek and poached beam üêü
Rump steak was okay ü•© but we loved the sauce
Dessert looked beautiful and tasted surrealü•π
Service was quite quick and the staff were very friendly‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"On a 10 day trip to Glasgow recently this was by & far the best meal I had. I found it on my 1st cold ,rainy day in the SEC neighborhood while looking for a place for dinner before the World Championships madness started the following day. The 3 course meal was amazing & the host Kevin was lovely & welcoming. The bread was divine, the duck sublime, the pasta delicious & the dessert was the best part. Highly recommend & I look forward to being back on my next visit x"
"Visited back in December as a pre-xmas treat, had a lovely time and enjoyed all the food and the service was friendly and attentive.

There were some great individual bits on offer across the menu and everything was very enjoyable, but nothing that really blew my socks off. I'd happily eat here again, but as it's on the pricey side it maybe missed some of the magic I look for at this price point to make me want to rush back."
"An unbelievable experience! The food was utterly sublime, with every bite being a taste sensation. We took the 6 course tasting menu, as was an afternoon sitting, we didn‚Äôt choose the wine pairings. The cocktails were amazing, from a new twist on an old fashioned to the pink fizz!
The staff were great, they explained every course in detail and were very attentive throughout and we never felt rushed, even though we were there for over 3 hours.
Brilliant food in a lovely setting, we can‚Äôt wait to return!"
"Fantastic tasting menu and matching wine. Smashing service with dishes and wines being explained. All the dishes were great, tasty and leaving you wanting some more. Matching wines we very good, great selections from Eastern Europe, some you just would t expect. We also added a fantastic cheese course and took a vegetarian option, instead of the beef tartare‚Ä¶ service was excellent in this regard, nothing was a problem. Great night all round. We‚Äôll be back for more."
"Lovely food in a lovely setting.  We had an early lunch and it was beautiful quiet.  I'm sure with a few more guests the atmosphere would have been perfect.

The chicken and asparagus was fantastic and absolutely the highlight of the lunch."
Our dining experience exceeded all our expectations. We are not new to fine dining and Lorna‚Äôs creative cooking topped the list so far. Cosy private venue. Superb service. Phenomenal food. 3-hours felt like 3 minutes and at no point we felt rushed. Thank you very much Lorna and the team. Thoroughly enjoyed the unique dining experience that you all gave us with 100% attention to details.
"The ingredients were exceptional.

Beautifully presented in both plating and ability to allow flavour to shine.

Courses were correctly portioned to ensure a smooth tasting experience.

The casual ambience is matched by the relaxed front of house staff. They read us well and we enjoyed our conversations with them.

Highly recommended. It's obvious to see why the Michelin star hangs here."
"My recent dinner at Cail Bruich was truly exceptional. From the outstanding food and impeccable service to the delightful atmosphere, every aspect of the experience exceeded my expectations. Without a doubt, Cail Bruich deserves a second Michelin star for their outstanding culinary mastery."
Our first visit and very impressed....everything was FANTASTIC!!!! Siobhan was very attentive and good chat. Mr Sommelier was very knowledgeable and gave us some interesting tips! Flavours were amazing and some unusual combinations that worked so well. It was to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and it was incredibly special and the card on the table was a lovely touch. Thank you to everyone!!Jamie & Leza
"I was there for the tasting menu with my wife for her birthday and it was simply superb. Every part of the experience from the hard working and knowledgeable staff, who make each of the exquisite and beautifully prepared courses, made to perfection from the extremely hard working and expert chefs in the kitchen with Lorna, with the just the right amount of discrete theatre at the table to make them both exciting and memorable. The attention to detail and craft for each dish component is amazing and the Michelin star is well deserved. We absolutely loved it and will certainly return. Fantastic."
"This was a fantastic restaurant for a nice night out. I went here with a friend and we both got scallops and venison, both of which were amazing. The service was also very good, as our server was attentive and informative. Overall I would definitely recommend going here at some point if you can."
"My main is less inspiring ‚Äî ricotta and chestnut croquettes. The powder gives the sprouts a tempura-like crispness. The base of the squash puree is cold, though, and the rocket garnish miserably flaccid. The croquettes themselves are floury ‚Äî overwhelmingly so. One is pleasant; two is a chore."
"Venison haggis lived up to its hype, the sauce is everything! Wonderful staff and beautiful space. The only regret I have from this experience is the mac and cheese, which was dry and tough. Maybe adding more cheese might help?"
"I had an extremely delightful tasting menu experience. The staff were very knowledgeable about the wine and the food, and seemed as excited about it as I was. Some very clever presentations, as well. The ambiance feels lush without being stuffy or overbearing. I would absolutely bring anyone I know here."
Amazing decor.  Great drinks and menu.  Loved having a vegetarian tasting menu.  Wish they advised we needed to specify if we wanted a tasting menu when making our reservation.  Glad they were able to accommodate.  Time in between courses was a bit long.  Looking forward to coming back.
"I would recommend it to a friend. We ordered focaccia, artichoke, sea trout and squid. All were delicious except artichoke which tasted like the ones you had in a jar from a supermarket. The atmosphere was amazing in the restaurant with candles and all."
"Visited recently for the first time and it‚Äôs one of those rare places that lives up to and even exceeds their reputation. Some of the best food I‚Äôve had in a long time, everything was delicious, atmosphere was good, and the staff friendly. Can‚Äôt wait to return."
"Gloriosa is a culinary delight of simple goodness.  Honest , fresh and healthy food.  The focaccia is to die for.  I couldn't fault any dish in any way.  Presentation, taste and portions 100 percent satisfaction."
"Great service, warm staffs and delicious food!
Good quality of food, you can see how detail the chef is.
It‚Äôs a bit expensive to me but it worths more than you paid for."
"We have been many times to Gloriosa and always really enjoyed the food and general atmosphere. We have come with friends or just ourselves and like the mediterranean sharing plates. When we went most recently we got seated beside the front door which kept hitting us with wind and banging. The service was bad - while the small plates came fairly fast, we waited ages for the bigger plates (with no drinks as another wasn‚Äôt offered). We noticed that after the table next to us paid, the girl was waiting for her friend to use the bathroom to leave and she got told she had to move and couldn‚Äôt sit to wait, so she had to stand awkwardly between tables. The food was good but not as amazing as usual. The focaccia is amazing and I liked the eggs and panna cotta. But the clams were full of sand, the cavolo so salty it was inedible so that dish was way too expensive for what it was. The artichokes were ok but not incredible. I hope it was just a one-off but we were disappointed overall. We will definitely try again."
"Good food and great service only criticism is maybe the service charge being automatically applied to the bill however,the waitress was really good, very attentive and we didn't have an issue paying it on this occasion. Would definitely return"
"Ideal stop for lunch. Lovely setting and pleasant, welcoming staff. Every part of the meal was thoughtful and complimentary. Love the  pork belly with hazelnuts."
"My mum had her 60th birthday in the room upstairs.

Great night service was great. There are a few mistakes on the set menu, but it was all really good food and great staff.

Recommended."
"Went for a Sunday roast (beef) which was great. Service was good, walked in a busy Sunday night with no reservation and was seen to right away.

Atmosphere was lovely, food was delicious (sticky toffee pudding was unreal). Would recommend for a nice sit-down meal, spent 40 on roast dinner (surcharge for beef) with dessert and a pint which was fair for the quality of food"
"I went here for the Burns night with a friend and it was a spectacular evening, the atmosphere was wonderful, the staff were really good and attentive.

The food was great but not to the standard I would have expected for a higher end restaurant. I loved the haggis, neeps and tatties though the ham hock & lentil soup was just OK. The cranachan cheesecake was quite nice. My friend loved her salmon starter though felt the sticky toffee pudding was a bit heavy. She also thought the haggis was delicious.

The whisky flight was very good value for money considering the price of the bottles, I had the Isles one and would recommend it. We also had a few bottles of red wine, the cheaper ones tasted better than the more expensive bottle.

I'd definitely go back but would try other options on the menu along with another whisky flight üòÄ"
"Stravaigin delivers a lovely dining experience. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, perfect for enjoying a taste of Scotland. I tried the lamb rump and haggis, and both were absolutely delicious! Definitely a spot I'd recommend if you're looking for a charming place with good food."
"I went for the Sunday set meal, the haggis neeps tatties with pepper sauce starter were excellent. The roast beef with vegetables was not as good. The glazed carrot was just a small slice of carrot, the beef was quite rare. I was not given the choice of how I would like my beef. The roast potatoes were nice but few in number. The broccoli and cauliflower cheese were fine. We did wait a long time for the main to turn up."
"Had a gift voucher to spend but definitely a place to go for excellent service and food as a treat. Sat upstairs which had low ceilings so if you are claustrophobic I would sit downstairs. Starters was the caramelised tofu to share and it was superb (forgot to ask what the sauce was) - recommend! Mains were rump steak and ox cheek, and chunky chips (crispy on the outside and fluffy inside). Steak was cooked to perfection, very tender and the sauce it came with went well with our side of chips; ox cheek fell apart, there wasn't any need for a knife, and the sauce was rich. Anyways, our server Cameron was attentive and friendly, the rest of the team - Marquis, Ilaeria and Sophie were on the ball! Hats off to the sous chef for doing well with the steak (sorry Head Chef looks like they raised the bar)."
"After a brisk walk through Kelvin Park we arrived at Stravaigin, the Cellar. We were seated after my partner managed to smash a glass through careless control over her hand bag. We were presented with menus and I chose the Haggis Neaps and Tatties which came as three equal sized portions with sesame seeds. I followed this with steak, chips and pepper corn sauce. The waiter checked back on us a few times which was a nice touch. The desert was a small meringue with a sorbet and so apple shavings???
We had coffee, paid the bill and thanked the waiter.
This is a nice place to eat in a busy local venue."
"Excellent place. Even though I didn't know you had to make a reservation, they seated us at the bar area and served great food. Selection was limited because they had a ""busy weekend"" and was out of steak and some other assorted menu items. I had the haggis to start and pork belly as a main. Superb!"
"First visit to this exceptional restaurant, wont be the last.
I would go so far as rating it my favourite restaurant.
Ambience - quality. Food - exquisite. Service - outstanding.
Thank you Ryan and your team."
"What a lovely dining experience! Food was fantastic, the bread with chilies was one of the best slices and a nice start to the meal. Cullen skink was great, too. Reasonable pricing and staff - from reservations to host to servers - were all exceptionally friendly, accommodating, and gave above par service. Very old school and traditional and would definitely return again."
"Good place, beautiful decoration, helpful staffs. Attended the wine dinner event last evening - the foods are all of good quality but not quite impressive. Although it‚Äôs an event of wine, I don‚Äôt really feel for the wine pairing. A good place if you wanna try traditional Scottish dishes!"
"Really tasty Scottish fare, the Highland venison was exquisite. Delicious desserts.
Fancy location, tastefully decorated.
Late evening reservation
Lost in our own world for much of the evening as we‚Äôd finally gotten to celebrate our Anniversary due to busy schedules
However, service noticeably rushed and mildly passive aggressive by the end, we were the last patrons. Marred the experience."
"An institution. 150 years old restaurant. Waiting staff, excellent. Menu, good choice , mostly seafood. Quality of presentation and flavour, high. Mother-in-law has been in the restaurant business for fifty years and is very fussy about her fish but absolutely loved her fish main course. Thought there was a little too much potato in the seafood chowder but flavour good. The decor and atmosphere comfortable not stuffy."
"First time I booked a table was March 2020 and we all know how that worked out üò• First actual time I had the pleasure of visiting Porter & Rye was in August 2021 and I have been a frequent guest ever since üòÇ (even my bank app thinks
I have subscribed to premium steak delivery). Anyway, after trying many different streak houses in Glasgow (which are all spectacular btw) nothing hits home quite like Porter & Rye. I used to live around the corner and it was my favourite restaurant of all time, now I stay 60 miles away and it‚Äôs unfortunately still my favourite restaurant üòÇ Book P&R today and join the fan club of Baked Alaska flavour changes and definitely order a cocktail/mocktail when you‚Äôre there (especially when Dan is there but they are superb all the time). Not sponsored and I still think the cow is creepy but it‚Äôs actually comforting now üòÇ"
My wife and I were there for the first time for our 21st wedding anniversary after lots of recommendations. I can say we were not disappointed. Everything from the quality of the food to the top notch service was excellent. Would highly recommend.
"Probably the worst steak I‚Äôve had in a really long time. Must‚Äôve been an off night based on the reviews, but I will not be returning. Service was decent. Mine was 2X maybe 3X sides were good but the steaks were horrible."
"We had a fantastic dinner at P&R this weekend - we arrived early but were well looked after until our table was ready - before our allotted time. The service was really excellent and food came at just the right pace. The food itself was very delicious , perfectly cooked and well presented. Definitely recommend."
"Excellent steaks and sunday roasts.
Good wine selection.
Staff are always friendly ,professional and knowledgeable.
Fantastic service
Nice atmosphere and good value"
"Great service, fantastic food. The rainbow trout with wipped goats cheese was unusual and outstanding. Deserts a great end to a really good meal."
"We had dinner at this lovely place. The waiter was very kind and charismatic, which absolutely contributed to the ambiance in the restaurant. The dishes were of good quality and were ""complex""; a lot of well chosen, special and tasty ingredients. The pricing is fair.
(The pigeon starter is very tasty, I forgot to make a picture)"
"Harry was very welcoming, patient with good knowledge of the food. The dishes were amazing, extremely tasty, delicious textures, and well thought out. We can't wait to come back."
Still ranks as one of my favourite restaurants in Glasgow. Top class food and service at affordable prices. A Glasgow must visit.
"The venue is small so I would recommend booking. The food is tremendous and the staff are so nice. What‚Äôs not to like. Will definitely being coming back for more. The desserts were delicious we had the chocolate fondu, sticky toffee pudding, apple crumble and oh so delicious custard and the cheeseboard. They were all fantastic and to be recommended."
We had Zoltan as our server. He was so nice and polite. We tried a new sharing dish and he spoke us through all the ingredients. The meal was amazing. Great service
"The Service was amazing, the food was quick to come out and the quality was unreal, we got the butchers block and it was more than enough for two, the cocktails were unreal.
The final bill was a lot of money, but I felt it was well spent on the quality and service, I would recommend this to anyone! Food heaven.

Thanks Mags!!"
"While the food fell short of my expectations in terms of taste, I found it to be slightly overpriced. However, the waitress provided excellent service and was very sweet. The atmosphere of the restaurant itself was pleasant and inviting."
"Michelle was an amazing server!! Very attentive and friendly, made some outstanding recommendations! The halloumi fries were a fantastic starter! The Ribeye was tender and flavorful! The sticky toffee pudding was a perfect dessert! Amazing restaurant, I will be back!"
"Absolute quality, the food is phenomenal and service is second to none! Remember though‚Ä¶it is a steakhouse!!! The starter of sticky chipotle chicken is amazing, T-bone steak (medium/rare) is fantastic and apple crumble with custard is just excellent! Our server Ryan was extremely polite, helpful and very professional! The whole experience was amazing! üåü ‚≠êÔ∏è üí´"
"Delicious lunch with dishes of the highest standard coupled with excellent service. They create a lovely atmosphere which is relaxed and fun but still focussed on all the little details which you would expect from a Michelin rated restaurant. Comparing it to other similar places we‚Äôve tried it really nailed this balance. The food was fantastic, allowing excellent ingredients to shine."
"We had the Six course tasting menu with premium paired wines. I‚Äôve eaten in a lot of Michelin restaurants and Graeme and his team have got it just right. Elegant and stylish setting and superb service, without the stiff over formal atmosphere. It was welcoming and relaxed, the flavours and textures were intelligently combined and paired perfectly with some sublime wines. The staff were well informed and very professional. Quite possibly the best culinarily experience I‚Äôve ever had. Thank you Unalome! You made our valentines night unforgettable."
"Absolutely fabulous restaurant‚Ä¶ great local ingredients, seafood is always amazing. The mix of different flavours is smashing, it‚Äôs a real treat and in a great venue. Both lunch and evening menus have a great variety and all delicious. The service is easily the best I‚Äôve experienced, the staff are willing to do what they can for you. On this occasion, lunch, we got a matching wine set created for us and a cheese board‚Ä¶. It you‚Äôre looking for a treat  this is a must visit."
Went on a Friday night for the tasting menu and wine pairing. Food was borderline faultless with great service and interesting wine pairings. Up there with the best tasting menus/meals I‚Äôve had in 2023!
"My first Michelin experience in Glasgow. I enjoyed everything, especially the foie gras, sea bass and the dessert. They also have amazing bread with creamy butter!

What impresses me most is that they prepared a surprised petit four for me: when chatting I said I came to Glasgow for my first job and it has been just one month. At the end of my meal, staffs came with congratulations!! It‚Äôs quite warm and I‚Äôm quite grateful for it.

Their foods are of good balance so that you won‚Äôt feel too heavy, friendly service and kind staffs, will come back again!"
If you haven‚Äôt eaten at eighty eight what are you waiting for?! We visited today and the food (sharing plates) and dessert were delicious and so were the cocktails. Managed to get a pic of dessert but not the main meal as it disappeared very quickly. This place is definitely a new favourite. Would highly recommend üëåüèΩ
"We had a wonderful meal at this small but cozy restaurant. The food was excellent - bold and full flavours. We love a sharing concept and had 10 plates in total for our group of four. The plates came out at a steady pace, we never felt rushed. Small but good wine selection. The staff was exceptionally friendly and welcoming. We went to other, more expensive restaurants in Glasgow but this was by far our favorite. We spent 245 pounds which included 3 bottles of wine - a very fair price. Absolutely recommend this spot, we will definitely visit again next time we're in the area."
"Used some vouchers that were actually bought for the sister restaurant but decided on Eighty eight.
It did not disappoint. Great food and great portions"
"This is a lovely little place in the West End of Glasgow. It does small menus and small plates, but everything that comes out of the small kitchen is delicious. Service is friendly and informed. Booking is essential.
We went on a pasta special menu evening."
Incredible coffee and even better pastries! They have the most gorgeous cups and the atmosphere is really cosy! I personally loved that you were offered a choice of single origin for your coffee and the menu included tasting notes to help you choose. I am keen to return to try out their selections of wine one evening!
"Nice restaurant found almost by chance during my visit in Glasgow.
It‚Äôs an Asian inspired cuisine and they recommended to take 3-4 small dishes to share and one or two ‚Äúmain courses‚Äù with some side dishes.
That‚Äôs what we did and we found the food very delicious! I really recommend the corn ribs and the fried mushrooms, so good!
We‚Äôll definitely visit this place again because there are still so much dishes to try on their inviting menu. Great service, it was all perfect!
We spent around 85 pounds in two and we left full and satisfied"
"Outstanding.  My general rule is if I do not understand the menu items, I do not eat at the restaurant.  This place is one of the few exceptions.  It was chosen by my friend at the recommendation of a local.  The menu is unique and contains many flavor profiles and items that I have never experienced.  We trusted the chef and went with the sharing menu.  The chef is a real artist who put together robust flavors of seemingly strange or unknown ingredients that really complemented each other.  Dont overthink it.  Have a little faith and try these unique creations.  This is New York, LA, Vegas, Paris quality food in Glasgow.  Plenty of food and reasonably priced."
"genuinely some of the nicest food i‚Äôve had in the longest time. i came here for my birthday dinner and enjoyed every single aspect of it. the fried oyster mushrooms were enlightening. the beef tartare was otherworldly and honestly, it‚Äôs been two weeks and i‚Äôve been craving it ever since then. the mussels were delicious, and we ordered a side of rice and spooned the juice from the mussels on top, incredible hack, was absolutely delicious. the beef skewers genuinely made me see god. perfectly grilled and just the most flavorful tender meat. the corn ribs were a first for me, but it was love at first bite. why isn‚Äôt corn always served like this? besides being easier to eat, utterly beautiful flavor. and finally, the fried chicken with the caramel glaze. my partner and i argued for the longest time over how you were able to achieve chicken that is THAT crispy, while still remaining juicy. even after 10-15 minutes of sitting on our table, drenched in the glaze/sauce‚Ä¶..you would think that the crispiness would start to fade. you think it might get a bit soggy. guess again. you bite into it, and it‚Äôs still JUST as crispy as when it arrived to the table. how do you guys do it???? actually, don‚Äôt tell me. i prefer to imagine you as little wizard chefs producing the best birthday dinner i‚Äôve had in a very long time. i visited on march 14th around 6/6:30pm, and everyone who served us was an absolute dream.

also!!! the entire restaurant was super clean, looked very cool and the most important‚Ä¶the bathrooms were spotless!!

thank you guys for such an amazing dinner ü©∑"
"Omg the food is amazing! I can be a bit nervous about trying new foods but virtually every dish (my group basically passed around every dish we ordered so we could all try it) was amazing! The oyster mushrooms in particular were delicious. The staff were so lovely and patient. The entire setup of the restaurant is so pretty.

My one complaint would be that I hated paying ¬£4 for a glass bottle of coca-cola ü§£ but honestly everything was so lovely. I'll definitely be back."
"The food at Ka Pao is second to none. We asked our server for recommendations and they didn't disappoint. I love that the food comes out as and when it is ready which allows you to graze at your own pace. The flavours in each dish were delicious and the presentation was impeccable. Service was excellent, very friendly interactions with three staff members left us feeling attended to and appreciated. We will definitely be returning."
"Wow! This place is absolutely stunning inside. First visit here today. Great menu, portion sizes are decent which I love, we had intended on a desert, however after ordering our sides (the mac and cheese and onion rings the best I have tried in a while) we couldn't move so opted for coffee instead üòÄ.  I had the scallops and pork belly to start, I'm not normally a fan of pork, this was first class! My friend had the croquettes  and we both had the roast dinner (with it being Sunday after allüòÄüòã cooked to perfection. Nicole and Joseph who served us where both lovely, friendly and efficient. The place opens at 1pm on Sunday just a few of us in, then all of a sudden it was packed. We had booked it and I would definitely recommend doing that. Great upbeat vibes and background music. Definitely worth every penny. Just go üòÄ"
"Absolutely fantastic festive lunch. Started with a simple
Booking process, the restaurant was very accommodating to our various needs - we were a group of 23. Food was tremendous, very tasty, good time between courses and plenty of it üòÇ. Staff looked after the whole group very well, no long waiting that you would expect at this time of year. Drinks were excellent too, great selection of cocktails. We will be back.. cheers"
"Wine & steak were delicious (although the whiskey cream sauce was a little light on the whiskey, although still very tasty) and staff were very friendly and welcoming. The smoked bone marrow served in the bone with caramelised onions on top was wonderful too.
My photo doesn't do it justice!"
Best steak restaurant in Glasgow. Service from Andrew was wonderful. We were greeted to a lovely booth and the atmosphere was spot on. The food was that good we managed to squeeze in a dessert üòÑ
"Delighted with my experience at Gosht restaurant! Introducing a friend to Scotland, I sought a quality halal steakhouse, and Gosht exceeded expectations. The ambience was lovely, service warmly welcoming. The sirloin steak was a revelation‚Äîundeniably the best I've ever had, incredibly juicy. The mocktails were beautifully crafted. While it leaned towards the pricey side, the exceptional fine dining experience made it worthwhile for special occasions. A special shout-out to Ellie, Rueben, and the talented chef who made our evening memorable on Friday, 26th January."
"Updated review after the menu change.

The fried chicken on the bone is gone and has been replaced with fried chicken thighs without the bone but with the same amazing flavours as before. It will take me time to process the change but these new chicken thighs taste great but they will never live up to the fried chicken from before. R.I.P Kimchi Cult Fried Chicken. Sad times.

We tried the pizza and as tasty as it is it just somehow doesn't fit with the menu in my eyes. The flavours are great and even with my disdain for deep pan pizzas they still were tasty ""pizzas"".

I'll update the review once I get a chance to try the new bibmbapbox."
"The food was great, the chicken was wonderful(light and crispy)! Love the soy chicken, gochujang chicken was a little sour but was good, the bibimbap is a must! And the burger.. is a burgerüòÖ I should've tried the chicken burger cause their chicken is a mustry!  The restaurant is small but it's nice and cozy."
"We were previously regularly getting the fried chicken as it was cooked very tasty and it had a distinctive crispy skin. Unfortunately, after the recipe recently changed, it seems the restaurant now uses breast meat instead of thigh meat, the previous crisp that gave the food it's character is lost. If the new product was what I wanted, I would have bought KFC! Disappointed as the old style chicken was one of my favourite dishes."
"Not sure if I ordered the wrong thing but my burger tasted like nothing. The kimchi on it was good, but that was all.
The bread is too soft and disappeared in my hand.
The chicken burger was a little bit better, but just very regular. Nothing special.
The whole place is messy with things everywhere, gives you an impression that they are desperate for a deep clean."
"5 stars for the food alone and 5 stars for service as it's self-service. Order from the machine on the wall and take a seat if you can find one. Great to share seating with strangers and meet new people.

The menu is changing soon, so you can't get a better time to go in and try their amazing fried chicken.

I used to go to Kimchi Cult when they where in London and the qaulity of food hasn't changed one bit. Best Korean BBQ in Glasgow by far."
"Stunning food, brilliant service and really reasonable prices.

We‚Äôve been twice now and both times have been incredible. Highly recommend!

Raj is a king amongst men."
"What an excellent  move this was tonight after visiting Riverside museum.A friend had told me that this place a haunt of old days had been refurbed and reopened. So today was an excellent opportunity  to revisit after years of absence.The menu is excellent .There is much more than Pakora to choose from. There are many items not available  in the more traditional  indian eateries.  After the obligatory Poppadums  and spiced onions,we had very unusual, sweetcorn and red pepper pakora and some really excellent Masala tatties both served with delicious  dips. We then shared an amazing Aloo Gobi
( Cauliflower  and Potato) and a very tasty Coconut  Chicken Korma. Paratha was also perfect. The staff were really, so helpful and friendly.  Really lovely people who answered our many questions  regarding
Ingredients  and menu contentüòä
Love the Tuk Tuk in the entrance  vestibule. Took me back to my many trips to Goa  Price was very reasonable  at ¬£44 for our satisfying  feast. Thoroughly  recommended. ü§ó"
"Quite nice, both the pakora starters and the mains (chicken korma and lamb rogan josh). I appreciated the care in asking for allergies and was told pakoras are fried separately for gluten free customers."
"Came here to celebrate my 23rd birthday with friends. Amazing atmosphere and service. Lovely chat, and energy from the owner and his members of staff. Highly recommend to anyone looking for some great Indian street food-at an amazing price!"
Mixed feelings on this one. It‚Äôs not a casual hang out bar with Indian based snacks on the side and it‚Äôs also not a fully fledged Indian restaurant. I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs the best recipe for getting a great experience. Service a highlight and was friendly and with old school Glaswegian charm. Food was tasty but not mind blowing and the menu is fairly succinct. Decor is comfortable and modern. If your not wanting a full on meal it‚Äôs worth a try
"Went for a valentine's night dinner, and despite the high praises I have heard about this restaurant, the experience was pretty lackluster. The dinner service was restricted to their set menu for Valentine's day and one could opt for a 2 course meal for 27.50 each or 3 course for 35 each.
My partner ordered a mains and a dessert sharing platter, and I went for a prawn starter and mains. The menu did not state that if you share the dessert platter it will cost extra and after we were reassured by the service staff that it wont be charged separately, when it came down to the billing time, there was an extra 7.5 quid added on top of our 27.50 each. There was also an added service charge, automatically added on top of that, both seems disingenuous to me. I don't mind paying service fee and having worked in the hospitality industry I will gladly hand tips to servers, but this was not acceptable. The extra charge for sharing dessert platter makes no sense, 'cos essentially my partner paid 35 quid for a bowl of pasta and 4 shot glasses worth of desserts.
We were told that the server did not know and she explained it to us incorrectly that it would be included in the price, and only after asking for clarification was one given to us. She also quickly went on to say that she would be happy to take off the service fee, as if doing us a favor while admitting to the fact that she gave us misinformation while taking the order. The whole situation left a bitter after taste, although the main course pasta was pretty good. The dessert platter portion wise was very disappointing especially considering the extra charge.
Food was decent, I liked my risotto but the whole billing experience did not leave me with a positive impression of the place."
"My partner and I visited here after seeing rave reviews online. For starters, we shared a ""Fritura Mista"" which is a mix of calamari, king prawns, white bait, and courgette served with a garlic mayo dip. It was flawless. Quality seafood, seasoned perfectly and so fresh.

For our mains, I had crab ravioli in a lobster claw meat sauce. My partner had a seafood risotto. Again, the seafood in both were of a very high standard, fresh, and both were seasoned to perfection.

For dessert, I had ""passione cioccolato"" - an award winning New York style chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream, which was fantastic.

Overall, we couldn't have been much more impressed with the experience. Staff were friendly and attentive, the service was prompt, and the food was outstanding. It's the best Italian restaurant we've been to and we will definitely be back"
"what truly sets this restaurant apart is its attention to detail, particularly in its use of mirrors. Mirrors line the walls, reflecting the soft glow of candlelight and creating an atmosphere of intimacy and sophistication. It's like dining in a fairytale palace, where every corner holds a new surprise and every glance in the mirror reveals another layer of beauty.

But it's not just about aesthetics; the mirrors also serve a practical purpose. They make the space feel larger and more open, creating the illusion of endless possibilities. And let's not forget about the practical benefits of mirrors in a restaurant setting‚Äîthey help guests feel more comfortable and confident, allowing them to check their appearance discreetly without interrupting the flow of conversation.

I even wrote a short poem because I was so inspired!

In mirrors' silvered sheen, reflections dance,
A symphony of images, a fleeting glance.
They capture moments, both joy and sorrow,
Echoes of yesterday, hopes for tomorrow.

In mirrored depths, secrets lie concealed,
Whispers of truths, yet to be revealed.
They reflect the soul, in its purest form,
A window to the heart, in the quiet storm.

In mirrors, we find beauty's embrace,
A reflection of grace, in every face.
They magnify dreams, and fears they betray,
In the mirror's gaze, we find our way.

So cherish the mirrors, both old and new,
For within their glass, lies a world anew.
In their silent depths, we find our truth,
Mirrors, oh mirrors, eternal youth.

Absolutely Lavish ü´∂üèªü´∂üèªü´∂üèª"
"My wife and I had chicken and mushroom risotto, lasagna, and calamari for a starter. The risotto and calamari were great. The lasagna was good, too, but the sauce perhaps a bit burnt, giving the lasagna a smokie taste. The servers were attentive even with the large number of guests and the atmosphere cozy."
"Wonderful place.
Excellent food. Great service.,
Special shot out for the Mussels, which we had a shared starter.
The Spaghetti Arragosta was very good."
"The food are amazing! And the service is super!!! Special thanks to the Chinese lady in the restaurant for excellent service, also the gentleman who helped me with the wine! The service is just amazing!"
"¬£14.5 for 2 course. I chose main and dessert.   I ordered cheese cake . It is too creamy and not much cheese taste. A bit disappointed.

2nd visited for dinner on 28Dec 2023.
We chose the Pre-theatre Mena. We ordered starter and main course. Everything is good. I like the prawn cocktail and calamari fritti."
"We had such a lovely lunch...

The food was great. I liked the decor.  The toilets  are impeccable..

Frankly, I can cook at home. When I go out, I want good food...of course....but I really want to feel welcome. For me, the  sense of hospitality is extremely  important.
So, I want to be greeted, seated, and well- served. And that's  exactly  what happened...

The Staff are lovely...professional..and we thoroughly  enjoyed our meal."
Absolutely fantastic place food is delicious and staff are pleasant and friendly
"Very busy, very good food. Good attention and staff helpful and managed very well though busy. Short walk from Glasgow city centre, and convenient for rail and bus. Also do a great lunchtime deal. Very popular. Award winning restaurant over many years. Make sure you book for the evening."
"I really enjoyed a fantastic meal here with excellent food of high quality. We ordered the set menu which was ¬£43 per person. We got a very good mixture of starters, three main meals and rice, followed by a chocolate mousse for dessert.  The food was very very tasty. The building and restaurant area were exquisitely decorated all Thai themed."
"This was my first time here.  The food was great, the atmosphere was relaxed, all the staff were nice. Will be visiting again.  We went for the 3 coarse lunch menu. With a couple of add on's prawn crackers and 2 egg fried rice to accompany our main dishes and 2 large wines we paid ¬£84 for 2 people."
"My first time here after hearing so much about it.
Out with friends after work and dined on the early evening menu. Chicken satay to start was a large fulfilling portion followed by spicy beef salad.
The salad had a warmth and slight kick to it, but simply delicious.
Cannot wait to return again!"
"We stumbled upon Chaophraya while exploring Glasgow. It stands out as a gastronomic gem, offering the tastiest and most flavourful dishes we've ever had.

The authentic decor and vibes added an extra layer of enjoyment, creating an immersive experience that transported us to the heart of Asia. The genuine atmosphere complemented the outstanding culinary offerings.

Highly recommend for anyone seeking an unparalleled Asian dining experience that combines exceptional flavours with authentic ambiance."
"The entrance and interior decor of the restaurant are quite splendid, creating a fantastic ambiance. Booking a table in advance over the phone is very convenient. The flavor of the dishes is comparable to Ting Thai in the West End, but the prices are 2-3 times higher. This Thai restaurant in Glasgow is the only one offering Mongo Sticky Rice with Coconut Milk and Pineapple Rice, adding a unique touch. Lamb curry was average, and the portion sizes are rather small. A service charge of 12.5% is applied, which falls in the mid-range. The staff is reasonably friendly."
"Was here to hear Gasper Nail who is from Malawi with a group of friends great little venue, not sure what his instrument was, he was joined for some of the time by his manager on guitar"
"One of the great small venues and places to eat in Glasgow. Good selection of beers, I love that they have a tiny menu of great food that they change, when we were there we had chickpea curry with jasmine rice, daal and potato bits. All of it was really top rate!"
"Was in at the weekend for a gig. And must say I was very happy with the place, being Coeliac I liked that they have a range of gluten free food and drink. I even talked to the chef, kitchen is adjacent to the bar, and he and the rest of the staff seemed full understand food allergens.

Will be back"
"**Edit** Staff have changed over the past year and now they have a new menu. Good but overpriced for what it is. After learning how music acts are treated in this venue- ¬£50 between a whole band and charged for having a merch table - Im less inclined..

Love this place! Really unique vegan asian tapas-style grub - be an adventurous eater when you come here and you won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
"Nice enough place that was decorated well. The bar staff were nice but I felt they could have been a bit more friendlier, but they weren't unpleasant at all. We didn't order food as we were there for a gig but I noticed that in the open kitchen the chef was heating up portions of food in the microwave before it was presented to the table. Nobody that was eating seemed to mind but I just thought if I was going for a meal I would prefer for it to be freshly cooked. The drinks were very expensive and I was a bit shocked at the price. The downstairs venue was good for the gig but I could imagine it would be very cramped if sold out. They had painted the door and some wooden boxing around the room. It did have signs saying wet paint but it was hard to avoid and the girlfriend ended up with paint on her jeans. Great gig but I wouldn't go back and definitely not for food and drink."
"Decided on The Butterfly and the Pig for Sunday lunch because it looked interesting. Service was pleasant with Lauren but even BETTER when she handed us off to another server who had an amazing sense of humor, sadly didn't get her name.
Mushroom fritters shouldn't be missed! Perfectly crisp and outstanding flavor! Love the tiny bit of spice that develops as you enjoy the bite.
Sunday roast with sirloin wasn't hot, just barely warm even cold in places of dish, but still yummy with horseradish. The accompanying carrots were OUTSTANDING! Steak pie was beautiful and perfectly tender, order with mash, you won't  be disappointed!
If you're not from the UK, make note, if you want to dine in the restaurant, you must make a reservation, however, you may eat in the bar area, which is just as nice."
The food was fantastic! The Colin Coley and cauliflower veggie appetizer was fantastic! The sticky toffee pudding was OK. We need a bigger plate and moist pudding. We also created some ambience by lighting our candle. The steak pie looks delicious. My partner and his friend said it was good. We will return!
"Lovely wee place with loads of mismatched tea-sets and teapots! Very cosy and the food was great. You could order the Afternoon Tea (which was NOT expensive for an afternoon tea; I was expecting to pay almost double before I saw the menu) or you could get regular breakfast food, like a really nice Eggs Benedict or French Toast. These were all delicious according to the group I was with! Would definitely recommend, especially if you'd like to bring someone for a nice Afternoon Tea and chat!"
"I have visited twice now for the Sunday roast. The space has an interesting aesthetic, with different vibes at each part of it, so I highly recommend you book online beforehand, as this gets you a seat at the prettiest tables, behind the curtain, with freshly ironed white tablecloths and candle holders. The food is quite tasty, we tried the tomato soup, the roasted vegetables, the Sunday roast and the meat pie. However, one star is redacted because the meat pie came in cookware with peeling ceramic coating, which can potentially be hazardous for health and not something I wanted to worry about on a Sunday (or any other day)."
"Food was okay, as the steak which we ordered medium rare came out as well done, while there was a wee bit too much salt on the risotto. The former was rectified with a replacement steak, and not being charged for it (totally surprised). Happy with the recovery by the team, so +1 ‚≠ê to the team.

Honestly felt that the waitress was condescending when we asked to take the food orders after the drinks came. She said ""There are other tables that we are waiting to take orders first, but we can take yours"". Honestly an unnecessary comment if you aren't interested in taking our order. Totally could sense her unhappiness in being asked to take an order after that.

Surprisingly quiet on a Fri night!"
"Wow! Bustling atmosphere, amazing and attentive staff, great choice of menu and food was the best we have had in a long time. We have been to Naples, we know how good the pizzas are there and I must say Santa Lucia catapulted us back there with their authentic food! I heard great things and my expectations were high...Santa Lucia did not disappoint! A truly wonderful evening with my family to celebrate my birthday and we can't wait to come back. Thank you team Santa Lucia! X"
"Gorgeous place! The food, service, and atmosphere were a 10/10. The staff were the friendliest and most welcoming I've experienced in a long time. The food was so delicious, comforting, and full of flavour! This would be our regular if we lived in Glasgow! We will be back!"
"It was our first visit to Santa Lucia Merchant City and definitely won't be our last! The food was incredible! Everyone enjoyed every dish from starters, pastas, pizzas and desserts. The service was very friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is really lovely. We had a great dinner thank you!"
"Visited Santa Lucia for the first time this Saturday evening. The restaurant is welcoming and looks great both inside and out. We were greeted by very friendly and professional staff when we arrived and seated promptly. The service was excellent all night - fast, attentive and friendly. Special mention to our server Keira who was lovely and checked in regularly for drinks and to check if the food was all ok.

Moving on to the food, it was some of the best Italian food we have had in a long time in Glasgow. We shared some starters, mains and desserts. Everything was great and you could tell each dish had been thought through. The menu is not huge, but there is enough of a selection that there is something for everyone.

Can't wait to return and highly recommend people go and try here if you have not already - you won't be disappointed."
"Ok has to be said absolutely lovely setting in Santa Lucia the decor is beautiful bright and airy fantastic reception as we walked in from the head waiter very attentive staff but haven‚Äôt got to the good part as yet the food
We had muscles and lentil soup followed by the sea bass and chicken milenese all very fresh ingredients and flavours were on point
We were served by Paulina very helpful staff member and fantastic mannerisms
We‚Äôd highly recommend going and trying this little gem for yourselves
Looking forward to another visit very soon
Thanks
Santa Lucia"
"We had the most amazing meal and afternoon at Gaucho if I could give 10 stars I would!  Took my mum here for her birthday and honestly could not fault a thing.  The food was just fabulous. Everything was so fresh and tasty. The Sea Bass Ceviche is a must try! I've had Trout Ceviche before but Gaucho's Sea Bass Ceviche is on another level! Absolutely delicious. Service was also exceptional. The staff are so welcoming and can't do enough for you. The management team, Ryan and Anton, ensured that my mum had a lovely birthday dining experience. As a wee special touch the chef decorated my mum's dessert with a happy birthday message which was so thoughtful and a lovely birthday surprise for her. The girl who served our table, I think her name was Olivia, also provided a 5 star service.  The actual restaurant itself is just beautiful. It is immaculate and has a really sophisticated but chilled vibe that you just can't help feeling relaxed in.  We absolutely can't wait to go back and the fact that it's dog friendly I will maybe be bringing my wee furry dog pal next time! üòÑ Thank you so much to all the team at Gaucho for a wonderful afternoon you really do provide a friendly and first class city centre dining experience! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"All 5 of us had a wonderful dining experience tonight.
All the staff were exceptional but a special shout out for Olivia, who did most of the service for our table.
The food was exceptional and all staff well briefed on the menu options."
"Sunday bliss at Gaucho  üçΩÔ∏è  we started with some cocktails at the bar before indulging in a delightful lunch with friends. Our booth was spacious and perfect for our gathering. The steaks were cooked to perfection, tailored to our individual tastes, accompanied by a great choice of sides and sauces. One friend opted for a steak salad, which was a hit! Our waiter's wine expertise added an extra touch to the experience, guiding us to the perfect pairings. Overall, it was a fantastic day filled with great food, drinks, and company. Highly recommend!"
"Came here for two special occasions -- birthday and anniversary -- and both meals were spectacular. The steak is among the best in Glasgow, and the appetizers and cocktails simply elevate the experience to an entirely other level. Definitely try the truffle arancini!"
"We love meat!
So we came hear with expectations. Unfortunately, one of steaks we ordered (raw) was more like medium rare. But the service immediately reacted and gave us a 50% discount at the end. Unexpected but very positive indeed.
The interior is just amazing. High class location.
Coming from Germany, having a glass of wine for 20 pound is, say, something not very common but it was really worth it. So, listen to the recommendations you‚Äôll get.
All in all it was a great time we had at the Gaucho. Thank you, Sam!"
"Restaurant has a lovely interior. The food was delicious and the steak perfectly cooked. The smoked salmon starter was a bit bland and presentation was odd. The panacotta was really good though. The service was quite disappointing in comparison to the food, and not very attentive. Overall a good option for a special occasion."
"Take their lunch set menu: street corn is amazing! However, the rump steak is just okay - good but not that surprising. Almond tart is good also they have a good red wine from Rioja.

I will come back to try other types of steak :)"
"What a incredible experience from the moment we arrived (albeit the table wasn't ready but that's ok)
I believe our server was Stefano, this guy needs a raise! He had so much knowledge of the menu from the steaks and the flavours, sides, sauces and how the bone marrow is cooked.

He went above and beyond.
The steak for our party of 4 (one had a burger but was equally very happy with it!) Was cooked to perfection and how we asked for it.
Bone marrow for me was a let down, underwhelming but that's a personal preference as I'm not sure what flavour I expected.
Otherwise I highly recommend this place for a good steak and truffle fries.

Perhaps offer truffle fries with the burger too though? Think they miss out with the skinny fries instead!
Thank you Stefano for such a pleasant experience, just wish the tip went directly to him!

Pictured is the bone marrow and scotch fillet. Others had the galacian which they said was well worth the money."
"Great little restaurant and bar. We only stayed for a couple of cocktails and some oysters (which were top notch), but all the food looked incredible. Staff were very friendly as well.

The old fashioned with Pedro Xim√©nez sherry was incredible.

Can't wait to come back and try the food next time."
"The food was absolutely amazing and I will definitely be returning soon. If you're looking for outstanding food and impeccable service, this is the place to go."
Stunning experience from start to finish - attentive waiting staff. Incredible oysters and lobster. Wine list was amazing - do you need anything else in life? ;)
"Great quality good portions and dog friendly what more could you ask for??

In case you do bring your dog, the rat traps are humane. Which can make them rather tasty for your dog should they go hunting under your chairs"
"Had a wonderful birthday meal. First time trying lobster, and loved it. Oysters were perfect too.
Lovely staff and cosy atmosphere."
We had an amazing lunch. I had the best fish and chips I‚Äôve ever had. Seriously. Huge portion of fish perfectly fried. Nice crunchy but light batter. The chips were amazing. My wife had a selection of their starters and all were excellent.
"Last minute walk in with friends . Just had a few drinks and some delicious chips.
Service  from host to waitress was tremendous.  No faults and area outside with heaters was very pleasant.
Food on the next table looked delicious so will be back to try a meal.
Well done to the hard-working staff  - not easy in hospitality at the moment üëç"
"Food was an authentic. I love it. I ordered spaghetti carbonara, calamari fried, and gelatos. But the only thing need to be improved is the staffs were not nice as they should be, no smiling, ask frequently for keep dish back even the food did not empty."
"I've been going to La Vita for years, and I still absolutely love it. The restaurant is in a brilliant location overlooking George Sq, the food as always is great! The only letdown (this visit only) was that the server wasn't very personal and didn't look interested at all. It might have been an off day, but that's the first time this has happened. The ma√Ætre d' on arrival was very welcoming. He was happy to have a little chat with before we got to our table. I'd happily go back anytime"
"Italian food with lots of options.
Got the garlic bread for starter but they‚Äôre a bit burnt but still nice, also got calamari, which wasn‚Äôt fried enough for our liking, the haggis arancini didn‚Äôt have much flavour.

The tagliatelle calabrese is very nice lots of sauce and sausage, very flavourful! I really recommend this! My friend had the Quattro stagioni which she found alright. I love how you can get half pasta here, very accommodating.

For dessert I had the chocolate covered strawberry tart. The tart is quite dense, is massive portion, I had a lot of whip cream in the middle. My friend got the cheese cake which looking amazing but she found it too sweet.

Tried the festive cocktail merry kiss mas, it was very sweet, if you have a sweet tooth it‚Äôs be perfect for you. The clausmopolitan is nice. I love the cocktail menu here, you have so many options to choose from.

The menu is big with good varieties. There‚Äôs plenty of seatings but not much leg room upstairs, the corridors are narrow, the decor is very festive, Craig who served us is great!"
"Food was amazing. Location is perfect. Atmosphere is cozy.
Authentic Italian food."
"A very warm and cosy environment. I went on Monday evening about 9pm, it was fairly busy. Staff were friendly and happy to help, the service was quick.

The mussels in white wine and cream were absolutely fantastic, and the inferno pizza was also brilliant. Will definitely be visiting again!"
"Came here for lunch as a party of 3
One of our party ordered from the set menu
Myself and another person in the party ordered from the main menu
The other party members had the parfait for starter which they both liked
Myself I ordered the scallops unfortunately my scallops were over cooked I went with a safe option being the Camembert which was nice
However none of us enjoyed the mains one being beef ragu from the set menu
Again myself and another party member ordered from the main menu one being the double cheeseburger which was overcooked and again myself I had the lamb rolled shoulder which was tough
The staff were friendly and eager to resolve our issues
Sadly I do believe in first impressions and won‚Äôt be back"
Lovely atmosphere. The burgers were delicious. The mash was star of the show though. Prices justified. Good date night location.
"Lovely restaurant, spotlessly clean with an excellent staff. Went on a voucher that was a Christmas present. Choices were very good and the food was excellent. Will definitely be back. The deal to me wax very good value for money and I recommend checking it out. All in excellent."
"It's been on our list to try... and we really enjoyed it. We ate using the 5pm market menu (2 courses for ¬£18). I had the cauliflower cheese and my partner had the chicken Kiev. For dessert we had sticky toffee pudding and creme brulee. Everything was really good and the service was great to be honest. Friendly, welcoming staff."
"Beautiful. Food was so lovely, very flavoursome. Lovely vegetarian option.  Would highly recommend. Atmoshphere was chilled out and warm. Staff were pleasant and so attentive and friendly.
Lovely little room to have a whisky in after dinner too.
Worth a visit!!!"
Absolutely unbelievable food!! My partner and I got the sharing platter for 2 and it did not disappoint. The portion sizes are massive and this could have easily done 3-4 people but anything we left was boxed up for us by the staff who were lovely. They also have do great mocktails. We have spoke about Turkiye EFES ever since and can‚Äôt wait to come back!
"We were a party of 7 who were looking for a place to have dinner. This looked highly rated on an alternative ratings site so we gave it a shot. They accommodated us really well. Although it was busy and bustling they put together some table for us in a great spot, and brought our food in a timely manner. The portion sizes were generous and tasty. There were some vegetarian options, which sounded nice, but this is a place predominantly for meat eaters. The lampshades were an amazing colour. I thought the mains were good value ¬£19 to ¬£25 including rice and salad."
"Very nice restaurant. We turned up randomly and they were very accommodating finding us a table. The place was very nice and had belly dancers.

They were accommodating with allergies and helped me order as well as gave me gluten free bread with butter whilst waiting for our meal which I very much appreciated and pushed this rating to a 5.

The food was good and I‚Äôd defo recommend and would like to return again."
"Such a great place to enjoy delicious traditional Turkish food. Fantastic service, large menu, lots of favourites! Despite being very popular, atmosphere is not too loud. Large portions, shareable plates, plenty of extras. 100% recommend if you can't get to Turkiye for dinner üòâ"
"Everything was outstanding from start to finish. Definitely the best restaurant I‚Äôve been to in 2023, and I have been to A LOT! The sharing platters are a must, although on the pricier side it is well worth it for the quality and substantial portion sizes."
"Often overlooked due to its somewhat unusual Central Station location, it‚Äôs also underrated. There aren‚Äôt many great steak restaurants in Glasgow and Alston is certainly up there with the best.

A somewhat quirky entrance leads you to a subterranean cellar venue with arches, marble and monochrome accents. Reminds me of a luxurious NY hotel or vintage gin bar.

Arriving on a damp, dull and thoroughly dreich Sunday we took advantage of the fairly priced set menu (2 courses ¬£25 / 3 courses ¬£30) and were not disappointed.

Portion size was ample and the beef was tender and rich. Vegetables all cooked perfectly and a decadent gravy pulling it all together and warming ones metaphorical cockles.

Desserts were beautifully plated and rounded off a comfortable, competent meal. Having been before and had some fantastic steak (et vino) I can heartily recommend."
"This place is fantastic. Amazing roasts, great beers and the music was good too. Would very highly recommend."
What a gorgeous quirky restaurant... A little hard to find as its in the entrance of the train station but the food was amazing... Loved the menu and the staff were very friendly and helpful when I asked them about the unusual cheese with figs on the starter menu... The chef actually brought us a big chunk of it with crackers to take home... So lovely and we'll be back üòä
"Service was painfully slow. Our food took one hour to arrive. The restaurant was half empty. We ordered the chateaubriand to share. It was good, but not excellent. The portion of chips was tiny. Onion rings and scallops were excellent. The peppercorn sauce was like gravy from cat food."
"Had the set menu, haggis croquettes lacking flavour. Ordered the d-rump medium rare, it was overcooked but the sauce and the chips are very good. Ganache as dessert is very good."
"RUDE. RUDE. RUDE bar staff and bartender. Friend came from Ireland so took her to a ""top"" hotel with a lovely bar... and that's where it stopped.
Bartender didn't even crack a smile. Was indifferent and bored. Wouldn't make the drink we wanted. Reluctantly made the drinks on the menu, which cost 14 quid each.
Bad experience and horrible service!"
"Celebrated my graduation here with my family and close friends. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the food was delicious and they even gave us a complimentary glass of Prosecco each for the special occasion! Would definitely come back and recommend eating here."
We had booked a 2 course champagne lunch (to use a voucher) only to be told they only served brunch on a Sunday - this was not made clear when I booked. One of the party was vegetarian (advised at the time of booking) and very little choice on the brunch menu for vegetarians although they did adapt a couple of dishes. Not sure we got the value of the voucher due to 'brunch type' dishes - poor dessert selection - again because this was a brunch menu and not a lunch menu
"My partner took us here for our Anniversary dinner, it‚Äôs beautiful inside. I ordered the soup as a starter which was fine, nothing special in my opinion. The burger was lovely but don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the ¬£15. Chocolate mousse was very nice. Staff were lovely, gave us both a glass of free champagne as it was a special occasion. Overall it was a lovely restaurant, maybe a little overpriced for some items on the menu but wasn‚Äôt too crazy."
"All staff following new guidelines, masks worn all the time, hand sanitizer everywhere and social distancing in force. Staff also prompted other diners to follow the rules...

Food was good, menu simple but well executed. Fish and chips were good. Small plates were interesting - chicken terrine was lovely and a generous salmon starter went down well.

Cocktails were good, staff happy to go off menu as well. Service was great as usual, happy to recommend"
"I recently dined at this restaurant and had a truly phenomenal experience. The food was absolutely amazing, with flavors that danced on the palate and left me wanting more. We ordered two steaks, one medium rare and the other medium, but there was a slight mix-up as one came out rare and the other medium. Despite this minor hiccup, everything else about the meal was impeccable.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is simply stunning, creating a perfect backdrop for a delightful evening out. It strikes the right balance between elegance and comfort, making it an ideal spot for both casual and special occasions.

What really elevated our experience was the waiting staff. They were very nice, kind, and incredibly accommodating. Their attentive service made us feel welcomed and well cared for throughout our meal.

Overall, our dining experience was excellent, and I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for superb food and a wonderful atmosphere. The staff's professionalism and the overall ambiance are sure to make any visit memorable."
"This was always on my to do list and finally was able to pop in at the weekend. Great selection of Scottish food lots of locally sourced ingredients. Best Cullen skink I‚Äôve had to date. Price wise really good they also to a set menu for 1, 2 or 3 courses which was greatly priced I think ¬£17.95 for 2 course and ¬£22.95 for 3? Service was great too everyone was really attentive and friendly."
"Had dinner in the Mharsanta and wasn't disappointed.
Great atmosphere in the spacious restaurant. Lovely service from enthusiastic staff.
The food was delicious and ample portions and the Tennents lager was a piece of art.
Really enjoyed our evening meal at Mharsanta."
"Amazing service by Abby! Our first time in Glasgow, came across this local place as  the best Scottish restaurant in GLA. The food was delicious! Haggis pakora, black pudding scotch, beef pie and barbecue chicken were all outstanding! 25% off the menu on February too so even more enticing! Will come back!"
"Best steak and sausage pie, great portion and very filling! Service was quick and steady with not long waiting time. Would highly recommend coming here for some food if you are visiting Glasgow."
"Food was barely OK, not impressive, as average as it can be. Service was nice and efficient.
Their location within Ashton lane, the nice garden & indoor service area are the highlight here I would say, very cozy and welcoming loved my table and they are dogs friendly."
"Gorgeous interior giving off a European pub and beer garden vibe, with indoor and outdoor seating. The interior was cozy. We went on Tuesday and it was a fondue and raclette night! Was fun to self-prep the cheese. The fondue was okay to share between 2 people. It was a good experience but the platter was quite basic. The service was average, very friendly but I think they were a bit stretched in staffing."
"Went to Brel for a birthday meal and had a great time. Seated in the terrace and although the weather was not the best the heaters, food & atmosphere made up for this. Kids loved it and Coco had a great time as well."
"Bring blankets, but not your appetite! Dined here for the new Sunday roast for two, but literally had to ask the server if another plate was coming. The temp inside was Baltic, but they did provide blankets -- and the fondue gravy also provided have warmth. The portion was small, and the meat cool, and it tasted like the potatoes had been cooked from frozen."
Went here on st Patrick‚Äôs day. Was pleasantly surprised we could use our it is on voucher this day. Loved the food. The staff were very helpful and the value for money was fantastic. Something really different for us and we really enjoyed it. Would recommend and return for sure.
"Enjoyed the 5 course ""Total Trust"" menu, excellent food and value at ¬£25. Couple of small points, coffee came before dessert and no teaspoon with coffee, slightly nippy waitress when asked for teaspoon and dessert. Was overcharged by ¬£30 on bill (Inspire instead of Trust), sorted out okay. Rest of staff were really nice. Would recommend."
Loved it. Did a 10 course tasting menu and guessed the dishes too. I would say im a BIT picky but i LOVED 9 out of 10 of the dishes (i just hate mince pies!) Would have personally liked to have each course served faster. Definitely recommend. Something different.
We went for the total trust menu (¬£25 on a sunday) for 5 courses which you dont know in advance. The food was brilliant the service was brilliant. We will be back for sure.
Very well presented and tasty dishes. And with the 10-course menu for ¬£30pp you simply can't go wrong! Staff is always friendly and helpful too.
"Finlay, who attended us is so friendly, knowledgeable. He has provided exceptional service. The foods have always been fabulous. I always love Modou's creative menu. The attention to details and used of ingredients always surprise me. I have always know I will enjoy the food, the hospitality yesterday was first class."
"My husband and I went here for the first time today. We arrived on time and were seated immediately. The red haired male server was very friendly and fun. Our server Dylan took over and took our drinks and lunch order.he did advise there might be a little wait for drinks as they were so busy. The place was jumping and had a bit of a party atmosphere - which was great at 2pm. The food was delicious, as were the cocktails. Everything was presented beautifully.  The staff were just lovely. Dylan was very attentive and helpful, as was the female with dark hair and glasses (sorry, didn't know the others names) we can't wait to come back"
"We visited Turtle Bay on a quiet Wednesday afternoon. Somehow, despite there being few people around the place still managed to maintain a colorful, vibrant atmosphere. The decor really lends that West Indian feel, as do the sweet Reggae beats playing in the background.

The staff were friendly and attentive. Laura, our server was particularly nice... Top marks!

Food wise I wasn't sure what to expect as I've never tried Carribbean cuisine before. I was, it must be said, very impressed. My partner and I shared sweetcorn fritters and crispy squid for starters. For our mains I tried the Shack Stack burger, whilst the missus had the Kingston chicken with Mac and cheese... The food was dynamite! Couldn't recommend it any more.

If you're in the city and looking for some top grub come to Turtle Bay... You won't be disappointed."
"Went here for a boozy brunch, which includes 5 cocktails and some food. The cocktails were amazing and stronger than we expected them to be as we thought they would mainly be fruit juice. The portions for the food were quite small but I think that was just because we had a restricted menu as part of the boozy brunch. Servers were very attentive and made sure we got our cocktails just as we were finishing the precious one. Overall the brunch and the cocktails are definitely worth the money and I will probably go back just for the cocktails."
"Lovely food, friendly service, fun place!! It's a great addition to town and a vibrant venue to try something a little different with Caribbean flavours. I wasn't too impressed with the cocktails I tried but at least there are a lot of them and reasonable prices! I would definitely go back and try more food as I really liked it. The curries were great and the sweetcorn fritters are a must!"
"The ambience is great. Food is delicious. Service is good. Just make sure you book a table in advance.
Although we didn't have a booking but the staff accommodated us. üòä"
"Have walked past this place many times and always wanted to try it. Took the chance this week and was not disappointed. From arrival friendly staff, although a feeling of 'chaos reigning'. Shown to our table, menus provided.  Took a bit of time to get orders given for drinks and then too have them delivered, but not in a hurry, so there no real issue. Food ordered and again delivered in fairly good time.

The quality of the food was first rate, but that is what I would expect, ur paying a premium.

Food issues. So I ordered a medium rate rib eye steak and got a steak that was one half medium rare, one half medium, but not much of an issue. As an extra ordered surf and turf, prawns option. Expected more than two prawns for the price.

So in all content, but felt a little ripped off.  You pay for everything as an extra.  Meat and chips included, but everything else (sauce/S&T) is extra. And when you are paying a premium, this seems a little over the top.

I enjoyed my visit and would happily go back but not at the price they wanted."
"I was there for my birthday with my dinner with my fiance & we had a couple of cocktails, lovely food & we shared a bottle of fizz, which was really nice. We had great service & the atmosphere was good as well. When we went into Bar + Block restaurant, there was a female singer on & she was really good. I would go back again, but maybe go for lunch during the day. Excellent restaurant & Excellent food."
"First time coming here for a meal, and I was very impressed. The food was amazing! The staff were lovely and welcoming too. This restaurant has a chilled family atmosphere and I look forward to returning again in the near future!"
"My first time going, o/h had been 3 or 4 times.with friends

The chicken, dear lord the chicken is absolutely beautiful/tender.  I always loved a half roast chicken but so many places stopped selling it.

O/h got the steak.

Others got the ultimate so the chicken, bit of beef, bit of lamb.  Our other guest had lamb.

Gravy pots are really small but can ask for more.  My roast potatoes were really drink but I got more gravy.

Got a side of pigs in blankets and the mushrooms.  So nice.

Water for the table, they didn't sell pepsi max (my fave) but do have diet coke.

We booked.

Toilets are upstairs but they have a disabled downstairs.

Beautiful interior, big, lovely design.

Staff really nice, repeat drinks took a while to come for with the food and it wasn't overly busy but otherwise great and would certainly go back 4.5/5.

They also have a boozy brunch style menu  ¬£30 for drinks (cocktails) and food, think I saw cheesy bites so we will need to check that out sometime."
"Every time we come to this Bar + Block we have a fantastic meal.
We've always found the staff to be professional, friendly and very helpful.
On this visit, we were greated by Waheed, a really nice guy from Egypt, who was very polite and friendly and likes to call you by your first name if your amenable for him to do so, which was refreshing. He couldn't do enough for us.
We decided to start with 4 small plates for ¬£21. They consisted of  Asian Crispy Beef (Tossed in hoisin, cucumber, spring onions, chilli and coriander), Garlic King Prawns (Cooked over charcoal with plenty of garlic butter, served with stonebaked flatbread), Salt + Pepper Squid (With fresh chilli and parsley, served with garlic mayo) & Beef Burnt Ends (Drizzled with homemade chimichurri). All were really nice, but the Asian Crispy Beef and Salt + Peeper Squid were sensational. We were off to a good start.
We had the 14oz Spiral Cut Angus Ribeye & Bar + Block House Salad with Salmon Fillet for our mains.
With a side of Onion Rings and a Baked Potato.
The Ribeye was absolutely fantastic, it melted in your mouth like butter, The triple cooked chips were really crispy and I loved them. The Chimichurri sauce was on point as well. The Onion rings were super crispy and melted in the mouth also. The salad and Salmon had the perfect balance of salad, dressing and avocado. Along with the Salmon and Baked Potato, was a major hit for my wife. We were full this time and had no room for a pudding. Another great meal at Bar + Block and it was a pleasant experience with Waheed. Looking forward to our next visit."
"One of the best Indian food (authentic feel like in India üáÆüá≥)

Must visit even loved by the Scottish people ü•òüßÜ‚ù£Ô∏èüòª

Not too much spicy and tastes amazingly amazing triggers your taste buds and at moderate price. Best for team lunch, family gathering and friends.

If you want to have a taste of proper authentic Indian food then my suggestion would be to try this and I am sure the food and service will not disappoint you.

Thank you team ‚ÄúThe Dhabba‚Äù üëçüèªüëª"
"A wonderful find in the heart of Glasgow! We had yellow daal, sabzi takatak and plain rice and I was pleasantly surprised by the authenticity of all the dishes. After a number of days of having mostly English food, this was a welcome change üòÉ the staff were polite and attentive."
Quite amazing and authentic Indian food in the heart of Glasgow. Plenty of indoor seating available. The menu is quite extensive with amazing cuisines. Must try if in Glasgow.
"The Dhabba is a highly-rated Indian restaurant in Glasgow, Scotland. It has been open since 2002 and has a loyal following of customers. The restaurant is known for its authentic North Indian cuisine, which is made with fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection.

The Dhabba's menu features a wide variety of dishes, including tandoori meats, curries, biryanis, and vegetarian options. The dishes are all cooked using traditional Indian methods, and the flavors are bold and complex. The restaurant also has a good selection of Indian beers and wines.

The Dhabba's interior is decorated in a traditional Indian style, with plenty of leafy plants and warm lighting. The atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming, and the staff are friendly and attentive.

The Dhabba is a great place to go for a special occasion or a casual meal with friends. The food is delicious, the service is excellent, and the atmosphere is good.

The Dhabba is a great place to go for Indian food in Glasgow. The food is delicious, the service is excellent, and the atmosphere is inviting. I highly recommend it."
"All things considered, this place is just average and I would rather visit one of their competitors. I will say the food tastes pretty good and is presented well. It took a while for it to come out, about 45 minutes after ordering, which wasn't great. The prices are very high for what you get, especially given that some of the other Indian restaurants around Glasgow offer actually better food at reasonable prices. The waiting staff were nice, but overall service wasn't excellent. I liked the idea of the menu replicating the look of a newspaper, and the interior decore was nice.

I would just recommend you skip this place if you're craving an Indian and would rather visit one of their competitors in the southside or elsewhere in Glasgow."
"Good food, good service and a good location.

All vegetarian.  There were several very good dishes and my favorite was the cashews with seaweed salt.  Quite the combination."
"It‚Äôs okay and that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt really recommend taking the fried goat cheese and the roast pears together since both of the 2 dishes are of heavy rich texture and you will be quite full in the end. I feel I almost cannot take anything more in the end of fried goat cheese, and I don‚Äôt really want to eat the pears at all. Finally, I finished half of the roast pears.

Also, the dessert coconut rice pudding is a hot and creamy one, not giving me any refreshment but just strengthen the greasy feeling. It‚Äôs worth noting that their dessert white wine is great and gives me some fresh notes.

They put everything together, making it not a clear starter/main dishes/dessert, in that way I‚Äôm feeling I‚Äôm in a rush to finish everything..

The price is reasonable and staffs are helpful, but I think I will try other combinations since this time I wasn‚Äôt quite impressed by it. These dishes could be good if served as single dish, but the combination of them is not okay for me."
"Had such a lovely evening here, perfect for a date night and large groups as it is a tapas style restaurant. Didn't get any photos of the food because it was too good to not eat straight away. The menu is limited, but all options are vegetarian with many of vegan dishes also. As a meat-eater myself I was impressed that it didn't feel lacking. The staff are so attentive and friendly, they really added to the dining experience."
stunning. was in a group of 6 so we ordered almost everything on the menu and got to try it all and left very full. portions are well sized for the price. not a big drinker but the orange wine we had was lovely and it's definitely catered to people who like unique wine. will be back
Very nice experience at the place! The chicory salad with hazelnuts was unique and the vegan polenta came with lots of mushroom! Probably the mushroom was on the salty side but that was offset by the plain polenta. Definitely worth the try! I wish their babaganoush was vegan! Traditionally babaganoush does not need yoghurt in it!
"I went here for my friends birthday. It‚Äôs a very beautiful place and the decor is nice.

The food overall was ok. It‚Äôs not the best and it‚Äôs not the worst. I had chicken and chips basically and my chicken was not seasoned much and it was a bit hard to cut in. I would say it‚Äôs a bit overpriced. Service was ok as well."
"Think the food is of a particular taste or style so personal choice, but the wettest runniest risotto I have seen served before. Although they did take it off the bill and serve a cream traditional style cake along with dessert as an apology. Carbonara was very highly peppered as well so I also found that strange and overpowering which meant my son couldn't eat it.
So service would be 5/5 however ¬£90 for a sharing starter, 2 mains and 3 ice cream sundaes.. but then ¬£4 for a can of coke and ¬£4 for diet bru is utterly disgusting.. atmosphere was fab and staff lovely but scandalous pricing for less than average food."
Went here for a birthday meal and was so amazed by the quick service and lovely staff. Food was served within 10 minutes of ordering and tasted amazing. Ordered a portion of the Garlic Potato Wedges but wasn‚Äôt a fan so they took it off the bill! Cheesecake was delicious and the fries were top-notch. Will definitely be back here in the future. :)
"Amazing beer/beer cocktail! They really have good beer: you almost didn‚Äôt feel floating even if drinking much. Good atmosphere with some stuffs to play with your friends.

Burger is okay for me, really in a big portion and I cannot finish it all :) also feeling the beef is kind of salty and dry for me with too much red cabbage. Overall a good place to have a drink late night!"
"Previously a 5 star review, 2 years later the standards have slipped. Surroundings still lovely and staff still attentive, but the food isn‚Äôt the same and it‚Äôs certainly not better. The beer menu has been significantly cropped so it leaves a visit significantly less interesting than previously.  My bet is that it‚Äôs closed before the end of the year"
"We went for Valentine's Day dinner and this is our first time here. For a 3 course meal, we had bread and olives which was really good with a variety of bread offered. We ordered 5 tapas - out of which the prawns were the best. The baked aubergine and lamb were good too. The food was delicious with sangria. Finally, we had a brownie for dessert, so yummy but the sorbet was so bad that we couldn't have more than a bite."
"5 for lunch and 5* for lunch. Great choice and service. A real ""hidden gem"" in Cresswell Lane. Not enough room here to say how good the food was! I will definitely be coming back here, and anyone reading this review should try it."
"Everything was great! Whatever you order you‚Äôll know will be good, we did a bit of everything: Patatas Bravas, Croquetas de Jam√≥n y Queso, different chicken and lamb options, 10/10 ‚≠êÔ∏è The service was also great, the dishes came out quickly one after the other."
Went here with a friend a wee while ago and it was so good! I‚Äôve been to Cafe Andaluz in Edinburgh and this one is way better. The staff were amazing and attentive and the food was delicious. The decorations were really nice and it was nice and quiet when we went. I highly recommend going here if you‚Äôre looking for good Spanish food and tapas!!
Food was good and very well priced! Must say that I was a tiny bit disappointed by the paella but it was still good. Great service and atmosphere and the restaurant looks absolutely lovely.
"The La Lanterna brand is held in lofty esteem in Glasgows culinary circles so I had high hopes in trying a fairly affordable lunch deal.

The restaurant itself is quite small and decorated with a simple Mediterranean charm. Bright and airy it feels intimate and upmarket. Location on Great Western Road is a nice compromise between Central and Byres Road.

The food was hearty and flavourful. Rich tomato, fresh and wholesome. At ¬£17.95 for two courses it was good value too.

However, if coming again I would opt for an evening meal as it just felt like it wasn‚Äôt in full flow and more going through the motions. The warm up if you will. Missing the X factor of a little buzz or exceptional service to elevate it to a full five star experience on this occasion. Quasi!!!"
"I think this is my new favourite restaurant in Glasgow.  The food was outstanding. I had big juicy mussels, monkfish wrapped in ham with a fantastic tagliatelle sauce and a superb cannolli. Quality ingredients balanced perfectly.  If I was you I would book now."
"Been here twice and both times were 10/10 for the food, service, atmosphere and just everything in general. Definitely my favourite restaurant to dine in the west end. Came today for my 21st birthday and the staff were lovely and very accommodating. The starter, main and dessert I had were total perfection and the drinks were great also, especially the strawberry margarita ü§©"
"Another great meal, every single plate brought out was perfectly set and tasted fantastic. Can't wait to go back again. Staff very professional and lovely."
"An excellent choice for a wonderful meal on a cold night. The pasta was easily one of the best meals of my trip to Glasgow, and was the perfect amount to eat. Staff was friendly but their reservation system is frustrating to navigate and it took me 4 tries to get a successful booking."
"My friend and I visited here in Nov 2023 and it was good. The staff were very nice, friendly and the vibe was chill. We had some starters and mains and we were given complimentary bread as well. Although we asked for more bread but there was no mention that it required pay but I didn‚Äôt mind. At the end we had a dessert on the house which was lovely. Great place in general."
"We visit this establishment time after time and never fails to disappoint
Extraordinary food
Amazing service with a smile - 1st class
Friendly team üòä
Humble chef and owner üôèüèº
Reasonably priced
Highly recommend"
"I've eaten here a few times on my visits to Glasgow. I can safely say that they make the best lamb doner ever! The aubergine lamb is excellent as well and so is the mixed grill. The starters are ok. The Turkish tea is superb!
It's nice to see that the manager patiently trains the young students who serve here part-time. They are very polite and despite the high pressure during busy times, they learn to manage the floor with grace."
"We had a delicious dinner at Eda, everything was flavourful and the portions were generous. We also had complimentary starters and salad which was a lovely touch and much appreciated! The service was great as well and as a vegetarian I liked that they had many options to choose from.  I will definitely go back."
"Fantastic food today. 3 of use shared hot mixed meze along with lamb chops, lamb meatballs and chicken wings with rice and salad. Really friendly staff and good atmosphere. My wife thoroughly enjoyed the Turkish white wine. Will definitely be back"
"I‚Äôm still thinking about this place!! Great breakfast and lunch options here. The gochujang chicken sandwich was incredible (although as someone who loves sauce, I wish it had a little more sauce/gochujang on it). The crispy edges were the best part! But that‚Äôs not all, you get a side of their delectable rosemary fries and a side salad. I normally don‚Äôt go crazy for side salads, but I don‚Äôt know what they put in there to make me polish off every last bit. Plus, portion sizes were very generous. Seems to be a great place to grab drinks as well, as I watched cocktails being distributed to tables. Dog friendly!!"
"Fantastic experience! Delectable food and super reasonable prices. Our waiter was kind, patient, and lovely to chat with. The food came out quickly and we loved everything. I would absolutely recommend the eggs with smoked salmon and one of the refreshing seltzers. If I'm ever in Glasgow again, I'll make sure to stop by this place for some delicious food and great people."
"This place never lets you down. Welcoming staff, wide selection of  menus - and including vegetarian and separate vegan menus - and they accept dogs!
This time I had the vegetarian Indian Pole Bowl. So delicious, freshest of ingredients and super filling. Happy ‚≠êÔ∏èHappy ‚≠êÔ∏è Happy‚≠êÔ∏è"
"This is an absolutely spot-on place for atmosphere, service & food.  It's not cheap but definitely NOT overpriced for the quality, taste and service of food.
I went with the chef's soup of the day (coconut & tumeric) accompanied with toasted sourdough bread and astoundingly salubrious and flavoursome olives - fresh water is served at every table.
Staff are lovely and genuinely helpful.
Will return! üíñ"
Went for breakfast today and we weren‚Äôt disappointed! The staff were welcoming and genuinely friendly. There was a good vibe in the restaurant/cafe. Great coffee too! A wee bit pricey however I would say that based on what we ate it was worth it and we can‚Äôt wait to come back again!
Absolutely fabulous place. I booked the upstairs function room for my 30th and it was perfect. The staff were great and allowed us to put up decorations. The preordered food was delicious and came out on time. We had a great time! Thanks so much!
"I love it here for drinks, but we got food today and what a rip off! ¬£13 for a pitiful mac & cheese and stale garlic bread, said to the staff they‚Äôre like yeah that‚Äôs how it is. Oran Mor up the street charging less for mac & cheese, least you get  an adult sized portion that fills you up. Won‚Äôt be eating here again."
"Went in for some food and had an unbelievable experience! The food was amazing, the customer service was fantastic. Big shout out to Brad for the service he gave us today! He was nothing short of amazing with us and answered all of our questions! It‚Äôs hard to find service of this level but Brad and his team went above and beyond. Will definitely be back"
"The burgers were good. The chicken roast was very poor, I could not cut the stuffing it was so hard, there were no roast potatoes and the veg were cold and hard. The pastry on the pie was burnt and the filling dry and minimal. Nobody came to check on us at all and no plates or glasses were cleared in the 90 minutes we were there.  The table had not been cleaned when we were shown to it."
"Nice pub with good food and board games!
It is absolutely huge inside, lots of seatings and good food!
The crofter‚Äôs pie was delicious, my friends enjoyed their steak pie and burgers as well. The sticky toffee pudding is great, the pulled pork chips are tasty. They have a good selections of drinks too.
The best part is that they have quite a few board games to choose from so you can enjoy food as well as games with your friends! Nice service as well !"
"Very delicious food and drinks. Quick, modern, and friendly and helpful staff."
"Had afternoon tea today with 3 friends. Food was lovely both choice and amount. Our server Grace  was so attentive and nothing was a bother too her, lovely girl. Setting spacious and very clean. We have been before for afternoon tea and would recommend to anyone for lovely time."
The food was lovely but the service was bad. Had to go and ask for our orders to be taken then again a half hour later to ask where the meal was. When it finally arrived it was delicious but we were too hurried then to really enjoy it.
God food god servive nice and friendly staff. Sorry for my bad England
The food was nice enough but the staff were not very well informed about the food and drink on offer so we're not very helpful when it came to answering questions.
"Nice atmosphere and lovely food! I enjoyed the fillet steak, very nicely cooked, although was more impressed by my partner's dish of choice which was a Trio of Lamb, truly beautiful dish and delicious. Staff were friendly and attentive. The chips that came with the steak were amazing! It's a small but cosy restaurant, I like that the place is central but in a quieter location on Bath Street."
We visited here to celebrate my wife‚Äôs birthday and this place did not disappoint. Both Trisha and Emma greeted us with such a lovely warm welcome and looked after us just perfectly. The food is absolutely amazing. We are not going to wait for a birthday until we go back. Love this place.
Was given a voucher as a gift and I would definitely come back. The food and service was amazing. Would definitely recommend the Mini Grill Steakhouse
"Absolutely loved it. My new favourite restaurant.
I had food envy before I'd even ordered because the menu is so good and I knew I'd miss out on something.
Haggis trio was some of the best haggis I've had. I begrudgingly went for lamb (instead of steak, in a steak place, I know), and that shepherd's pie is genuinely the nicest mouthful of food I've ever eaten.
Staff were excellent. Nice atmosphere, cosy but not too crowded. Good wine. A little pricey, but worth it!"
"Incredible food, incredible service and just an amazing place to eat! The staff are so friendly and make you feel welcome and possibly the best food I have eaten."
"Monica was lovely. This was our first meal out since getting married and she was super friendly. Service was very quick and she was very attentive, always checking on us for drinks and making sure our food was good. We are very happy! And can't wait to return. Thank you! She even gave us a glass of prosecco to congratulate us which I thought was a lovely touch."
"Very big space with an impressive variety. Love the fact that they put calories on the menus. And if you check the online menu you can even find the macros for the dishes. So rare! So useful!

Had üêî fajitas that were very tasty and fresh."
"We went on a Tuesday night, so it wasn't busy, but they do have a ton of seating. The atmosphere was amazing, and so did the interior. The wait on drinks and food wasn't too long. Food wise, I think it's a little overpriced for the quality and amount, but it's still good. The cocktails, though, are delicious. I definitely recommend the mango collins. The staff was also very polite"
"Food was absolutely delicious, we ordered 6 tapas dishes to share and every single one was amazing. Would definitely be back. We also turned up half an hour early on the off chance we could be seated early and they managed to squeeze us in. Staff all lovely and helpful."
Really like it here. A regular customer mainly because the vegan and plant based options are great. Recently were booked in for a boozy brunch and the food and cocktails were great - really good selection and also with the option to upgrade to a main from the main menu. Staff were really friendly and always attentive meaning we got our 5 drinks pp in a good time. Definitely will be back for this. Most of our party  ordered the non-vegan options that I haven't had before and also said the food is great!
"Unassuming and brilliant restaurant. It's a great place to try some Scottish classic dishes like haggis, neeps and tatties or a creamy smoked haddock chowder. The salad with whipped Goat's cheese was delightful. Fabulous food and very friendly service!"
"Food is fantastic, the menu has a great variety of dishes for everyone, the portions are generous and all reasonably priced.
Been here several times and never disappointed. Staff go above and beyond to ensure customers are happy. Special thanks to Frank & Sean, who were absolute STARS from start to finish helping us celebrate a 70th birthday meal this weekend. Cannot recommend this place enough, ideal place for a light brunch, dinner or a special occasion. 10/10!!! Thanks again."
"Came for breakfast with the wife and my parents. First time. Great wee find this. The staff are really friendly and the food is top class. My mum had blueberry pancakes and the rest of us had Scottish cooked breakfasts. By far the best breakfast I‚Äôve had in Scotland, never mind Glasgow. Been full all day. Back to London now for drab Full English. Shame. I‚Äôll be back"
"One of the best breakfasts I‚Äôve ever had, lovely staff, definitely recommend! Also really well priced for such good quality food!"
"Cant rate Roastit Bubbly Jocks high enough,  Frank and his team provide a great experience in real good food dining. Service, value for money, a unique and warm intimate venue atmosphere, he treats his customers like friends. Thank you, always a  favourite of ours. üëç"
"An anniversary gift from my sister , we really enjoyed our ‚ÄòCuban Afternoon Tea for Two‚Äô , a delightful selection of savoury and sweet tapas, and a cocktail each. I ordered the vegetarian selection for myself and was pleasantly surprised. Portions were good size and the desserts were delicious, churros were spot on mmmm‚Ä¶! The staff were great and very attentive. Nice decor, big and airy venue, would definitely recommend‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Visited for a work function, 18 of us, so a big crowd.
The staff were excellent, the place itself wasn't too busy which hopefully helped, but we had our food on time, which was delicious (I opted for the steak, of course). Drinks were brought out timely and we didn't have to wait at all.

The food was part of a set menu, so they knew knew in advance the order, but it was all still well cooked, tasty and barely a wait, all brought out at a reasonable time. Once all finished, we stayed for a few more drinks.

The smoking area outside was.. Interesting, met some colourful people (backs onto a car park), but this didn't matter. I have to stop smoking anyway!"
"We had a tough time getting a table at other places for a party of 6 but managed to get one in here on spec tonight. Food was excellent and the service was friendly. They forgot one of the starters, and mixed the burgers up at the table, thankfully the person hadn't started eating so that was ok but full marks can't be given."
Empanadas and croquettes were amazing. And defo go for the plantain tacos. Tapas great for sharing.
"Where to start‚Ä¶ had a look at the reviews for this place and they weren‚Äôt great by a long shot. Kept seeing reviews saying the staff aren‚Äôt great at all. We decided to give it a go anyway, our waitress was amazing (wish I remembered her name) we might of just been very lucky. With regards to food and drinks. My wife order a mojito and it was awful, was nothing like a mojito. In saying that all our other cocktails were very pleasant. The food was a major let down so if it isn‚Äôt right and you won‚Äôt send it back then don‚Äôt bother coming here. Both myself and my wife had to return our meals. I ordered the chicken burger, it was so overcooked and dry it was like sawdust no joke. My wife ordered the quesadillas and they were burnt black. The replacements were day and night. It‚Äôs a shame because if the food wasn‚Äôt awful the first time round then this place would of been really good.  Nice atmosphere and vibe especially with the live music."
"After a long day of exploring Glasgow, I needed an African touch and The Calabash African Bar and Restaurant was recommended. Had mama's special and it was not that bad. Had African Fanta as well. It was noisy from music and other guests though. But good location in the city centre."
"I had a lovely experience at this restaurant, located in Glasgow. I was hungry and wanted to eat my Nigerian delicacy. It was quite easy to locate by Google map. The restaurant itself looks good and neat with enough eating tables for customers, I rocked and enjoyed the afro music playing in the background, it gave me a feeling of home. Their menu contains variety of African - Nigerian food s, drinks and snacks. I ordered the infamous palm wine which I have missed for over 5yrs. The cost of food was OK, quite affordable. Good customer service, but they need to employ more staff to make the service quicker, I had to wait for about 30 minutes to get my meal. Also, the chicken I ate didn't taste like a hard chicken from Africa. The vegetable soup I ate was very delicious, but a bit watery. The pounded yam was perfect!!.
In conclusion, I didn't regret coming there, and hope to come back anytime I am in Glasgow."
The food here is AMAZING! I always get the  nyama choma (sizzling lamb) and the chikina awaze tibis (lamb with the delicious spongy injera). Bala is the best! We live in Edinburgh but he remembers us (and what we eat) every time!
Good food and night Africa home environment. Really feel no e to see other people of kind. Very nice place to meet friends. They have a variety of African and Caribbean foods selections.
"Wonderful for African dishes. Nyama choma and ugali is the best in Scotland, Githeri is also available."
"Lovely visit this evening to experience their taster menu. Warm welcome from the staff who looked after us very well throughout, all with a smile and cheery banter. The food and drinks arrived promptly. The menu demonstrated a great range of dishes with a lovely variety of flavours and textures. All were delicious! Looking forward to returning to sample their menu again."
"This was our first visit, despite it being a Thursday it was busy, maybe because it was the day after Valentine‚Äôs. The food was excellent, see photos. The mushroom/brisket/cheese sauce park of the dish was to die for. The Gluten free batter was very tasty. We will go again"
Fantastic meal and the vibe of the restaurant was great. We went for the Sunday roast deal which is such good value for money. Absolutely loved the food especially all the sides and how they were presented. Will definitely be back!
"The food was lovely couldn't fault it, Value for money excellent. However service was poor adjacent tables received lots of attention, Our table didn't. This really tarnished the evening as we enjoy interactions with staff."
"We visited The Loveable Rogue on a Thursday lunchtime, the place was not busy when we arrived but more people came when we were eating. It's a nice atmosphere, a lot of light but cosy, we sat in one of the booths.
We were welcome by Alex, a friendly member of the staff that talked us through the highlights of the menu for the day and suggested the right cocktails to go with the food, providing the explanation for his reasoning.
We went for crunchy oysters, Scotch eggs, white bait, lamb and potatoes with black pudding and cheese board.
I have to say that last time I had such a great food was at Michelin star grade establishment. The flavours and the textures were perfectly balanced and the attention to the presentation of the plates was clear too. Everything was enhanced by the fantastic drinks that everything was paired with. The bill came at about 60 pound each including a good tip, which I thought it was good value considering the amount and quality of the food, plus the couple of cocktails each. It's a great place and we will definitely go back."
"This is hands down a must try when in Glasgow! This was one of the top two meals I‚Äôve ever had in my life, tying with a Florentine steak in Florence. We had the Stormoway black pudding fritters and fried goat cheese appetizers. 10/10 on both. My husband had the venison stew (10/10)  and I had the venison pave (50/10)! The venison was EXCEPTIONAL and is from their estate. We had the crumble (8/10) and sticky toffee pudding (20/10) for dessert. Don‚Äôt miss out on their hour whisky. The rum cask was one I wish I‚Äôd found earlier in our trip so we could have purchased a bottle to take  home- such a unique. The atmosphere was lovely and the staff was very helpful and lovely. Also for all that the price was a bargain. I‚Äôm shocked it wasn‚Äôt double the price for this quality. You MUST eat here!!"
One of the best restaurants we've visited! Spacious restaurant with friendly staff and fast service! The food was delicious and presented beautifully! The staff member who greeted us at the start even stopped by to ask whether they need to call us a taxi to the airport after we finished our meal. Super thoughtful and attentive. Thank you!
"Haggis, neeps, and tatties were delicious. Well seasoned with silky flavourful gravy. My partner had the potato cheese gratin which was also well made and savory.
The drinks were well crafted as well, and did not disappoint.
Our server was very kind and helpful in menu selection, and regularly checked in on us throughout dinner.
I really liked it here, I would go again to experience more well made Scottish food."
"If you are looking for authentic, hearty, well plated Scottish food look no further. It‚Äôs a showcase of local produce in an upscale and well dressed dining area.

Portions and menu can‚Äôt be faulted on this visit but the service felt a bit underwhelming for a special occasion but Im willing to bet that might just be a post Xmas hangover and an off night.

It‚Äôs maybe more formal than some other eateries but it hits all the right notes in culinary craft. A thoroughly satisfactory spot to impress your friends or visitors."
"Food was incredible - one of the best meals I‚Äôve had in a long time. Cullen skink was out of this world, seafood stew and mussels all fantastic. And a very nice touch - they had Faragaia on the menu - the nice non-alcoholic spirit made in Scotland that was similar to a floral St. Germain. The service was also fantastic - prices were reasonable - I highly recommend Ardnamurchan for upscale Scottish food - we will definitely be back!"
"The fish soup (crab meat with ginger and coriander) is amazing. Crispy fried stone bass tastes well, especially with the lettuce salad.
The warm sticky toffee pudding tastes too sweat, not recommended."
"Been coming here for years.  One of my favourite restaurants. If you enjoy fish dishes this place is great, lots of delicious choices. The service is really good, very nice ambience, really enjoyed their fish soup with prawn balls."
"The chef and I must have different tastes. My main course, Halibut in Cullen Skink sauce, came with a substantial amount of smoked haddock. It had a powerful flavour. I would have enjoyed Halibut much more if there wasn't smoked haddock at all. Panna cotta wasn't appetizing either. We had a great seafood dinner elsewhere in the city centre for a much lower price so our expectations were not met."
The food here is top class as is the service. It was very busy and it‚Äôs not cheap. Can‚Äôt wait to return.
This excellent restaurant has been in business since 1998. It is not cheap but the quality of he experience shows why it has survived for this length of time when most others have not. It is not a great place if you don't like seafood because the choices for you will be limited. The wine menu is not extensive but there is plenty of variety and the description of the white wine we chose was accurate. It went extremely well with our food. We will definitely return.
"Have to say, slightly disappointed! This was a birthday present for me bought by my friends. Service was good, very attentive. Appetisers were probably the best thing about the meal, sourdough bread with chicken butter was lovely, as was the salmon cornet. I had roast of the day, the chicken was dry, Yorkshire pudding was rock hard and inedible. Desert of lime and coconut was just not nice at all. Far too sweet. Really wish I had not ordered that! My husband has beef which was very tough. All in all, I was very disappointed.  I had high expectations due to the reputation, but unfortunately, I would not return as this experience put me right off. Prices are far too high to have poor food! Vibes seem to be very posh, but the food needs to keep up with this or people will not return. Real shame!"
"Sunday was an absolute delight with my partner! The experience was beyond wonderful. The waiter was very accommodating, a friendly and warm demeanor. The restaurant's ambiance struck the perfect balance between classy sophistication and a laid-back, relaxing vibe. Food and drinks - they were simply amazing, I wholeheartedly recommend this place with a resounding 100% and can't wait to return!"
"Everything from the food to the service was fantastic!
It was hard for us outsiders to find,  but google maps finally got us there.  It was simply amazing spot to enjoy our 28th Anniversary dinner while in Glasgow"
"A very nice restaurant with brilliant service from staff. The food was quite nice but I wouldn't really say amazing. Being blunt, it doesn't warrant the prices they charge. I've been to restaurants with more flavourful dishes for much less. Not sure I'd be going back here in future in all honesty."
"Location on the first floor of the western club Glasgow.

beautiful interior, low lighting and patterned carpet to the first floor.

The restaurant design is chic, modern.

Good value 2/3 course meal with a discount if member of the western club.

The heritage tomato with goat cheese on puff pastry was excellent.

The coley with clams and sauce was also excellent. Coley was crispy on the outside and just done on the inside. Nice greens too.

Pinot noir was good.

Service attentive."
"Used to love sugo pasta, however a recent change in menu has removed pasta number 8 which was, to me, the best. No other pasta to me tastes that amazing that I'd wait the times you need to for a seat.

When sitting food comes rapidly however when waiting to be seated it can be a while, and while waiting for the bill can be even longer.

Sugo is good for a quick bite to eat and wouldn't recommend for anything intimate as the restaurant is very loud and busy."
Sugo Pasta is excellent! It was recommended by a friend and I‚Äôm so happy to have gone. There are great pasta selections and each are made fresh daily. We loved our dishes! We arrived just before noon on a Saturday and were seated quickly but there was a very long queue when we left! The restaurant is large so I think it moved quickly and is absolutely worth the wait! Great prices and great service as well. Will definitely be back!
"Best pasta in town. Glad to had tried Sugo during our short 2 days trip here in Glasgow.

Lots of table and the atmosphere is buzzing, but do expect a bit of wait for seats during dinner hour. Service was good."
"What an amazing place for freshly cooked pasta and great wine. You can't book, need to turn up, give your name and wait. We went to the pub opposite and came back 40 minutes later and straight in to sit down.
Pasta is freshly cooked and the beef Ragu was super tasty.
It was a Tuesday and the place was rammed. Very fast service and all reasonably priced."
"Great place for pasta in Glasgow! Serves a wide variety of pasta where most of them are scrumptious and good portion size for its money.

Loved the linguine in a Puttanesca sauce with Fresh Mackerel. Tastes very savoury with tiny bit of fishy taste for more layers of tastefulness. Not sure if it's available very day as it is from the special menu. The pasta with ragu beef was great too, beef is tender and the sauce is flavourful. Definitely try their tiramisu for dessert, one of the best I've had! Wines are also served here.

Definitely returning when visiting Glasgow next time."
"A lovely Italian restaurant in the heart of Finnieston. The menu is full of delicious dishes, making it difficult to choose from, as you simply want everything. It changes seasonally, so there is always something exciting to look forward to. The staff was attentive and friendly. Thanks!"
"Beautiful seafood cooked to perfection. Staff are delightful, very friendly and helpful. Polenta starter could have used a little salad maybe. Just being picky though. Will return very soon. Highly recommend."
A picturesque setting for a nice dinner. The staff is very friendly and hospitable. Their desserts are to die for. My favorite is their pistachio lava cake! Definitely recommend a visit.
"This restaurant is definitely worth a visit, our waitress was incredibly friendly and personable. The food was a 10 out of 10 so really delicious and the ambience invites you to relax."
"I won‚Äôt recommend it. The pasta I ordered was too chewy and salty ( I know it‚Äôs proper Italian way of cooking but it‚Äôs under cook to my tastes). The lasagne was ok. All in all, I won‚Äôt recommend it to a friend and I won‚Äôt go back."
"I recently dined at Mother India Restaurant and I must say, my overall experience was fantastic. The food was absolutely delicious, with every bite bursting with flavor. The ambience of the restaurant was also wonderful, creating the perfect atmosphere for a pleasant meal. While the service was not top-notch, as I was initially charged for an item I did not order, the staff was quick to rectify the issue and make things right. I highly recommend trying the vegetarian thali, which was not only perfect in taste but also more than enough for two people. And to top it all off, the gulab jamun dessert was the perfect ending to an already amazing meal. Mother India Restaurant is definitely a must-visit for all food lovers!"
Had a lovely meal here before attending a show at the hydro. The food was delicious and the service was very efficient. My only slight criticism is that staff are a little overbearing as we were asked 3 times in the space of a minute if we were enjoying our meal which I find quite off putting. I would definitely visit again though. I would recommend booking in advance as it is small restaurant and filled up pretty quickly.
Fabulous dining room we were seated downstairs. Best Indian food I've ever had. Fish pakora was fresh and light followed by sea bass with chickpea and potato. Staff friendly and efficient. Highly recommend.
Much anticipated but sadly the food was terrible.  I have had better Chicken tikka masalas from a Tesco ready meal than whatever this was supposed to be.  The pilau rice was tasteless at best.   When we rang them to complain they just told us to take it up with Uber.  Of course yes silly me I forgot the Uber drivers make the food.  Folks don't believe the hype about this place plenty of other Indian food restaurants out there.
"We were here before the pandemic, and from what I've heard it is your mainly saying.
When I asked manager about one of my favorite Indian dishes, they were able to accommodate me, even though it wasn't on the menu.

I really recommend this place. The atmosphere, the food, the service we're all outstanding

When we visit Glasgow again in the near future, we will be dining here with friends we're bringing with us."
"Been here quite a few times.

The girls got carbonara and dessert.

I prefer a mix of starters and a side (mushrooms in a white sauce and mussels in a white sauce which comes with garlic bread).  I also got a side of chips, I keep forgetting to tell them no salt, they always come heavily salted to the point I end up not eating them but my friend did.

We got soft drinks x1 each."
Beware of expensive add ons!! The portions are decently sized but the food is so extremely bland. I had the chicken carbonara and the chicken tasted old and chewy. The carbonara had no taste at all and I had to heavily salt it to make it edible. The pollo al Pepe and the steak were so average for the prices we were paying. The garlic bread also had no taste whatsoever. The cocktails were delicious but often the food would come before the drinks. However the staff were nice and the atmosphere was cute. Such bad value for money as the prices were absolutely extortionate!!
"Wanted a quick bite to eat pre-show.  This place had great deals on 2 and 3 courses.  Food was quickly received and was lovely.  The restaurant has beautiful decor.  Food is very reasonably priced and good sized portions.  However what is a reasonably priced meal becomes less so when drinks and service charge are added on.  Over ¬£6 for a Peroni is expensive, especially compared to wetherspoons the evening before."
"The place was good, service was amazing, we ordered pizza and garlic bread. but the pizza crust was overcooked. The garlic bread was lacking flavours."
Lack of communication and hustled out quite quickly.  Ordered peroni and got water!!.  Didn't have the cheesecake they had advised me of so they just gave me something else without asking. Constantly at the table asking if it was OK which was annoying.  Cleared the table really quickly which gave me the impression they didn't want us to stay too long. Food was OK and pleasant atmosphere.
"Been meaning to eat here for several years, having tried the food at a BBC Good Food exhibition. My wife's lactose intolerance was a non-issue. We had the pre-theatre fixed price menu (she had the dairy-free version, including a banana fritter). Loads of choice, delicious food, and the service was terrific. The chef even dropped by our table to say hello. Next time we are visiting Glasgow we will definitely be back"
"A very cute place. They closed their full menu earlier than their hours indicated. We were able to order from apps and salads. The food was pretty good. It was all cooked well and served prettily. Bathrooms were clean. Service was minimal and mostly forgot us. I couldn't make eye contact with a server to save my life, so it was a pretty thirsty meal for me. Mostly just enjoyed the ambiance. I'd head somewhere else if I was choosing again."
Beautiful restaurant. The food is absolutely delicious and it's a lovely atmosphere. Really great service even when busy.
"Food superb, one of the best gluten free / coeliac friendly menu options I seen
Staff were lovely &friendly and very attentive but not over bearing so
We would  definitely revisit next time we are in Glasgow"
"The atmosphere was very chill and very friendly staff.
We had duck and sunday roast! Which was very good, the scallops as well."
"My partner & I tried 2 starters, 2 mains and 2 desserts from their 3 course set menu. We love everything! From the service to the plating, and esp the careful & well put together pairing of fusion of flavours in each plate was simply divine. Highly recommended :-)"
"we ordered Crissssspy mushroom frittersss served with spicy mayo and a side salad, Suzie the smoked salmon mousse, hitting snooze on a bed of toast, served with a side salad, Butterfly and piglet burger and The swimming piggies... Pan seared king scallops served on a black pudding crumb with crispy pork belly, chorizo oil and a smoked bacon salt. The food is wonderful very creative."
"Really nice food. Pricing for drinks was a bit exorbitant but the great service made up for the cost for sure.

They were even so kind as to make our afternoon tea vegetarian friendly at absolutely no notice because I was an idiot and forgot that I was bringing my vegetarian friend with me. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ

Lovely selection of nibbles within the afternoon tea and great value for what you get.

The soup was also amazing. ü•∞

Would definitely come again and want to try their restaurant next time!"
"It's such a cute place, definitely worth a visit. Book a table as it's busy and you may need to sit in the basement which isn't as atmospheric. The food was very tasty and affordable too."
"Tasty and great atmosphere. But I paid ¬£2.75 for ONE slice of black pudding. That is very dear despite the cost of living crisis.

I did check with the waiter if it was only one slice and the answer was 'yes'.

Apart from this, it's a great place with a great service."
"I was on the fence about removing a star but in the end I decided it was more accurate to give 4/5.

We both had the 12 hour Barbary leg and shared a portion of fries. The food was absolutely delicious, the duck more or less fell off the bone and such a tasty sauce.

The star removed was for two reasons
a) the bathroom - it was a tad dark, a shelf was too close to the toilet itself (I banged my arm against it) and the sink has a tendency to splash because the water pressure is too high for the sink design
b) there was a used, slightly fusty straw in between the seat cushions and there were some crumbs already there when we sat down."
"What a treat! Great selection of food and drinks and a live buzzing atmosphere . be sure to make a reservation to avoid disappointment. They have a a good non alcoholic drink menu and vegetarian options too. I really enjoyed the boneless chicken and my partner enjoyed the scottosh fry up, the duck fries are delightful too - just the right amount of salt for that extra flavour !"
Wonderful breakfast if you want something a little different. We both ordered the duck leg hash. It was surprisingly spicy which I love and the bread was incredible. Service was also fantastic. Can't wait to visit for dinner!
"All day breakfast + all day lunch + dinner (we went on Saturday).  Really great, and good coffee too. I paid ¬£20 for eggs benedicte with avocado and bacon + 2 x coffees. We booked ahead for breakfast, I think it gets very busy so plan ahead."
"I feel this is a place that rests on their laurels and could use some rejuvenation. The food mains were good, but somewhat salty on the sides and veg. The service was definitely lacking in promptness. Our mains came out nearly 1.5h after arriving (we had starters)."
"It‚Äôs a lovely restaurant area and the staff are very pleasant. The menu has several vegetarian and vegan üå± options which is great, but I think the quality of those courses is probably a bit below the meat dishes.
Sunday roast is good."
"Really friendly staff, really fancy and tasty food. All arrived quickly. Really nice renovation since was last here. Definitely recommend. Is a little pricey but it‚Äôs definitely worth it as a treat as it reflects in the food and decor."
"This is the first time we have visited for many years after tonight‚Äôs meal I really can‚Äôt understand why we waited so long! Everything was lovely and from my point of view nearly everything was Gluten Free. This is because they create their own sauces and reduce to thicken to enhance the flavour rather than add flour. The menu has game meat on the menu. I had smoked duck starter followed by venison ( see photos). Then my ultimate treat Gluten Free sticky toffee pudding. Our next visit will be soon, no way am I going to leave a long gap like last time üòé"
We had the taster menu with the wine flight. The food and wine were a great match and made the evening great. Service was friendly and good.
"Definitely the place for a fancy occasion, it's otherwise a bit too pricey for a casual meal. But the service and atmosphere are sublime.

Their selection of ice wines are incredible, and the food overall were delicious. They looked small but were actually very filling!"
"The inside of The Ubiquitous Chip is worth the trip alone, so incredibly stunning. This is a must! Food & wine is awesome, service was really great! So glad we got a reservation here, added a great experience to our trip!"
"What an awesome find!

Hands down the best food we tasted in Glasgow ü§§ The location is super unique and the atmosphere is chic with a trendy vibe. Easily a romantic date night or dinner with good friends.

Great wine list and all the dishes were elevated with amazing flavor profiles. Their presentation was on point üëå

This will definitely be on our  recommendation list for friends and family traveling to Glasgow.

Would recommend a reservation, but general seating is available. Great location üíØ"
"Absolutely AMAZING food, could not even fault it. Cocktails... Well they could have been done better, but you work with what you got. Service lovely. But the food and style were just astounding. Well done to the chefs. Cause the food was bloody fab."
"Amazingly friendly staff, very tasty food, and quick service. Fairly limited menu, but everything we had was quite tasty. Prices were a bit high, but we received a discount as hotel guests. Worth a stop if you're staying at the connected Holiday Inn."
Lovely Christmas menu with hot food and hot plates.  A real difficulty is selection from a number of tempting sounding dishes.  Mist have a twist on the ordinary which makes a repeat visit a near necessity before the festive season ends.
"It‚Äôs an ok place with decent staff, if somewhat lacking in atmosphere. They don‚Äôt sell any Scottish beer or lager though - as a matter of policy. Just another foreign multiple. They won‚Äôt get my custom again."
"Nice restaurant; booked a table during the week for the 2/3 course special. The selections were great and the food was awesome. The staff there were also very patient, as we had a somewhat late booking. I got some minced steak as my main and creme Brule as dessert, can't exactly remember what my friend ordered but I've inserted a photo. I'd definitely recommend the place."
"So glad to have come across this restaurant! I love the concept; which is to a order small selection to share (great if you‚Äôre not feeling too hungry and if you want to sample multiple dishes). Definitely recommend the fried chicken, which was so crispy outside and juicy inside, the curries were spot on and deserts were amazing. The staff was great at explaining everything and was very quick to serve us. Definitely would love to come back here again to sample out other items on the menu! ü•∞"
"So many dishes too choose from & reasonably priced. I went with my brother and we shared 3 dishes each, which is the optimal amount.

Service was very kind & attentive to our table."
"""Ventured into the heart of Glasgow's West End to discover Ka Pao, and it's safe to say, this place left an impression! Nestled in a prime location, it boasts a spacious interior with a welcoming atmosphere.

The staff here are aces ‚Äì speedy and ever-helpful, they make you feel right at home. And let's talk cocktails ‚Äì they don't disappoint!

Now, onto the grub. For a starter, I tried the salt and Szechuan pepper oyster mushrooms with pickled mooli (vg). It was an explosion of flavors! The mushrooms were perfectly crispy on the outside, tender inside, and that soy lime sauce? A symphony of tastes in every bite.

I wondered if the main course could match up, and I went for the hispi cabbage with cashew nut butter and sriracha. The butter was a delight, melting into the cabbage, but the sriracha had a bit too much swagger, making the dish a tad on the salty side.

For dessert, I wrapped up with the coconut pandan and mango calamansi. It was a tropical paradise on a plate! Nutty flavors danced with the freshness of mango, and it was an absolute delight.

With an experience like this, there's no doubt ‚Äì I'll be back for more!"
"Great service and atmosphere.
Loved the food - only downside was that two dishes had similar flavour profiles to when I last went in 2021- the main, and the last dessert. The main, which was grouse - just a bit too hearty for me, and was seasoned with 5 spice, which was similar to the duck dish in 2021. The dish was very similar to what I had at the Balmoral earlier in the year... and I had the same issue with that as in, it just needs something to break up the richness of the protein. The dessert was milk and honey, was yummy, but just very similar to the 2021 flavours. The real star of the show for me was the mushroom dish with brioche ... was excellent. The service was spot on as to be expected.

Best wishes. M"
"The attention to detail is outstanding. From the servers, to the food itself. I thought I would be hungry when it was over but the courses were just enough for lunch. If you want a true world class dining experience, you go here. You will not be disappointed."
"Worth the 1* Michelin Guide.
Incredible food, as well classic and reinvented, perfect service from a well-rehearsed team.
It wasn't the first time I've eaten there and certainly not the last!"
"A new Gem for us.  We have walked by 88 numerous times and always said - looks great we have to try it.  We did - WOW - amazing.  Extremely impressed.   Superb food, flavors out of this world.  Amazing wines by the glass - probably the best wines by the glass I have had in Glasgow - if going by price definitely the best.

Lovely staff, it was quite being a Tuesday right after New Years and we got to chat to the very talented chef and lovely hostess.  Very nice people who love their job.

We will be back to try the cocktail bar and to eat at the restaurant again."
"Almost a five! The formula is spot on - buzzing vibe, interesting menu, dare to try something different, great staff (even if they are the victim of their own success). 'Small plates in a small restaurant' - yes, a bit on the cramped side. Food was interesting and generally excellent. Not quite sure about all the wine pairings. Reasonable value. Bottom line, absolutely would recommend and look forward to returning."
"We love this place - tapas style, small dish, price is reasonable to share in big groups (do come in big groups so you can try most of the menu - we regretted not having friends in Glasgow to try this). Definitely will come back!

It seemed like they have seasonal menu and change up the dish, so we didn't get the recommended beef caparccio. However, the rest of the menu piqued our interest.

We have:

- Beef tartare (11/10): Presentation was ON POINT! The beef was sweet, umami, the egg yolk was light and airy, croutons added lots of crunchy character and made it so fun in the mouth to eat. The horseradish gave a fresh and refreshing taste. AMAZING!

- Stone bass crudo (7/10): The fish was fresh, chewy, nice + paired well with the sauce. Definitely on the saltier side so we thought it would go well with some white wine. However, we don't like the hazelnut - it wasn't crunchy, the particularly hazelnut taste didn't blend well.

- Spiced haddock (9/10): The spice was amazing + the SAUCE. We licked the dish clean.

- Blood orange and fennel panzanella (9/10): The spice was amazing + the SAUCE. We licked the dish clean.

Even at 4pm, the place still had 4-5 tables so definitely recommend reservations."
"The perfect dining experience!
This was our second visit to Ox & Finch (the first in pre-Covid times) and it was just as we remembered it; outstanding from start to finish!
Every single dish we ordered was exceptional; you can tell that every dish has been thought through diligently and utilises the best ingredients with outstanding care to detail.  The recommendations from their excellent staff were amazing even though one recommended dish was out of my comfort zone it was perfectly balanced and tasted sublime - so thank you for making the recommendation.
I doubt there is a better restaurant in the UK let alone Glasgow which compares with the experience and food at Ox & Finch - this is not hyperbole on my part, I have dined in everything from casual establishments to Michelin starred restaurants across the world and I, personally, think this is the best restaurant I've ever eaten in - I only wish I lived closer so I could do so more regularly.
The range of dishes allows for any and all palettes to be satisfied, we ordered a number of dishes (some pictured) and they all complemented each other; thanks to the recommendations.
The staff are very attentive without being overbearing and on this particular visit they went above and beyond which was very much unexpected but very much appreciated.  They engage when you wish to and leave you to enjoy in the perfect balance.
I cannot recommend them highly enough, whether a local or on a visit to Glasgow make sure you book in for the perfect dining experience at Ox & Finch."
"one of the best MICHELIN GUIDE restaurant!

service was the best, explained well on how the food will come (tapas style : out when its cooked) & described the menu well

we ordered :
- fried artichoke (7/10) : mix of salty from the frying oil and sour from the yoghurt
- duck liver parfait (9/10) : very delicious! savoury from the pate combined with the toast & berry jam
- cod cheeks (9/10) : texture‚Äôs nice & a bit chewy just like scallop
- grilled coley (4/10) : too salty for us unfortunately
- slow cooked lamb shoulder (10/10) : MUST TRY! very delicious, lamb was very tender & juicy, combined with the herbs it was like HEAVEN
- pan seared pork fillet (9/10) : delicious & tasty, pork is juicy & succulent
- dry rump steak (9/10) : peppercorn sauce compliments the juicy meat

i recommend u to reserve online before visiting as it gets crowded"
"Went on a Friday evening. Had a really good time. The food was good and we loved the dishes. Great value for money and good portion sizes.

I recommend the crab tubetti, rump steak, slow cooked lamb and the feta cheese flat bred, absolutely delicious.

Server was friendly. If we are ever back in the city would definitely try again."
I enjoyed my experience here. The food was 10/10 so good so yummy. The staff are AH-mazing! So friendly and so helpful. Would definitely recommend and would definitely come back.

""" Life is Beautiful "" @ La Vita as are the meals and service. They handle the larger demands at this busy time of the year effortlessly.
Their traditional italian meals are exceptional but you`ve got to try their traditional scottish breakfast : )"
"I came here to have breakfast and loved the food. We came here after walking a lot to find a place to get some classy breakfast, and it was definitely worth it. The waiters were very friendly and the food arrived pretty quickly. Next time I will be here to get some nice lunch or dinner."
"Not sure if was because it was the week between Christmas and New Year, but the food wasn't anywhere near as good as our last visit.

The prawn and lobster cocktail was lacking in any flavour, with the prawn tasting like they had just been defrosted. The chicken was over cooked and very dry. Finally the profiteroles tasted stale.

Bad on this visit, I don't think I'd return."
"üíÄFOOD 2/10üíÄ I dont know why ppl bang on about this chain. Great decor. Great foodpresentation. Poor food quality.Overpriced.

I got the eggs benedict - and the muffins were stale, with no life in them. Not toasted. Nothing.
The haggis bon bons, were a waste sadly. Not much flavour in them. Pretty sure the ""fresh juice"" is from a bottle, too.
I think the only thing i enjoyed was my tea."
What a beautiful restaurant sends you back to the early 39-40's .staff are immaculately dressed and so polite and informative about food and wines .we had set 2 course menu with a lovely bottle of white .I had salmon with dark seeded pumpernickel bread and shepards pie for main .Well done everyone
"Very disappointing experience I'm afraid!
I was at Ivy Glasgow before but this time they weren't able to live up to expectations sadly.. Souffl√©, smoked salmon and chocolate bomb options were all ran out! I mean this is Xmas time if a restaurant at this level doesn't know  their market and demand after all these years then I'm not sure who should be! The food was lacking the wow factor when came out, we weren't particularly impressed with the look and taste which is very disappointing when you've set up such high bar for yourself!
Service wasn't great either you could see the staff are exhausted and not particularly thrilled to see you! the first servant wasn't so focused so accidentally dropped the knife on the table which could've easily ended in an incident; think he then preferred not to carry on with the service to us as poor guy was so embarrassed, and so passed us over to his colleague..
When desert was served we noticed a soiled teaspoon which wasn't helping at all after all the experience we had already!
And to complete the package when we were leaving and went to grab our umbrella at the entrance realised that it's gone! When asked a member of staff we were told it could've been lifted by someone! I mean are you serious?! At least don't offer customers to leave their umbrella at the door if you can't guarantee the security! Got really pissed by this as it was a sturdy brand new umbrella we got to use for the visit and now it's gone after a single use! Was raging and it ruined the whole experience even more so!
So no not a great experience this time round for us!
All the fancy stuff you see on the Instagram page is just for the sake of social media!
All that said, I do love the drinks and cocktails though and certainly do admire the interior design and ambience.."
Excellent service and very good food.  Great to see The Ivy doing a fixed price 2 course menu.   Portions could have been a bit more substantial
"Great atmosphere, I went in the Christmas time and the restaurant was super cute all covered by lights. The food was ok and the staff was super friendly."
"This restaurant was highly recommended, we came but didn't book a table, we were seated behind the bar and we understood because it was our mistake, but the waiters bypassed us and ignored us, they always left somewhere, we couldn't even call anyone . When it came time to eat, no one informed us that the food we ordered would be so spicy, the menu did not say so. The mussels were peppered with jalape√±o, which was not mentioned on the menu, and the curry prawns were super spicy. When we reported this to the waiter, he said that we should have warned him and he would have brought us yogurt to reduce the burning sensation, this is very funny, we didn‚Äôt  expect this, we expected everything, but not this response. The atmosphere was very good, but the evening was completely ruined."
"Had a fab meal today for Sunday lunch! Felt like royalty and the food was outstanding!
The staff were so attentive especially Ilaeira and Morven, kitchen staff went the full hog and beef roast was just so tender, not sure how they achieve such excellence in taste and flavour but everything was cooked to perfection. Cocktails were also top notch especially the espresso martini! Could have had more if we had more time. Really enjoyed sitting by the cosy fireplace and was nice to be accompanied by a few waggy tails next to us. Really was ant least 5 stars all round, keep being authentic and original!"
"Fabulous experience sampling The Mad Hatter's Tea Party menu. When each course is served it's expertly explained by serving staff and accompanied by a little theatre.

Absolutely delicious food served in beautifully decorated surroundings. I have read some reviews indicating that the tables are extremely close together. This is true but we didn't find it overly intrusive. Overall a fantastic experience."
"Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here. All 6 courses were very tasty, and we thought the wine tasting was fab. Took around 2 hours but did not feel like that at all!"
"Visited here as a treat as it is a bit pricier than some of the local restaurants, but I've wanted to go for a while, and honestly it didn't disappoint. The restaurant is small and usually fully booked, so getting a walk in is unlikely. The staff are attentive and polite without being overbearing. The Thai fusion menu was the theme when we went, the food portions are small, but it is a tasting menu, you are there for the experience, not to get stuffed full. I thought the food was delicious and creative with lots of different elements making up each dish. Being a bit of a fussy/limited eater I wanted to try foods I wouldn't normally eat, and the pumpkin spring roll gave me a whole new appreciation I didn't know was possible for pumpkin. I normally don't eat fish either, but the pan seared bass has completely changed my mind. If you want something a bit different to treat yourself, with a friendly and relaxed atmosphere, then definitely try this place."
"I love the idea of Six by Nico. But if you aren‚Äôt keen on one or two courses it feels expensive for the rest of the meal.

Dishes were well cooked, albeit not very hot, but well presented and full of interesting flavors.  I don‚Äôt like service change included on the bill, (although it‚Äôs optional) nor the charity donation."
"Great experience!
I came here with my family and had a great time. The service was fantastic, the vibe was very happy and excited and the food was good.
The dishes were very creative, interesting to look at tasty.
We all had the matching wines which paired very well. There was a matching cocktail for your first drink which was a nice change as well.

Tasting menu, matching wines, 4x extra cocktail and 2x extra snack course was around ¬£360 for 4 of us.

Had a great time with my family but don't have any intentions coming back for a while, not sure why, just left a little underwhelmed by the flavours."
"Our first time here and this is one of the best meals I have had for a while. Delicious, fresh, seasonal and well executed.

There was lots on the menu we wanted to try. We will have to come back to try some more dishes.

Favourites for me were the artichoke and the cacio e pepe. The red cabbage also. Oh and all of the rest üòÖ

It was a little pricy but I think it was worth it."
Superb menu and drinks list: really imaginative. Everything was beautifully cooked. The fish was outstanding and the vegetable dishes very flavoursome. The plates are not really small/sharing plates but are all quite big: 2 per person is more than enough.  Very nice candlelit ambience.
"This is the second time me and my partner have come here. It's a treat for us usually as we like to try many of the dishes and splurge. Its reasonably priced for the quality of the food. The food is delicious, beautiful, local and great recipes that you wouldn't find anywhere else. Staff are lovely, drinks are fab!"
"Very delicious, everything fresh and seasonal and the best focaccia I have tried Bit on the expensive side but def worth it!"
"I have been excited to visit Gloriosa for a long time and I am afraid I was quite dissappointed. We started off with foccaccia and it was very fluffy and delicious. It also came with a good portion however I expected a little bit more than just very salty olive oil to go with it. It is common to have a good dip with some herbs and spices.

We had their asparagus dish which was great with a citrus sauce, soft boiled eggs and a delicious creamy side with it. Their mussles toast were good as well.

We have tried their pork ragu, it was delicious. We have also ordered their tonnarelli pasta which was way too salty. Both pastas were too al dante for my liking.

Desserts were a huge dissapointment. I have never had a worse creme caramel in my life and it is one of my favorite desserts. Caramel was too bitter at a stage that it did not taste good anymore. You could not enjoy the creme caramel itself as it was so bland. We were confused as to where all the sugar went. The raspberry dessert was just alright.

On top of that they have this cheeky ""optional"" service fee. If they want to make it optional, they should let people tip however much they want rather than putting it on the bill.

Overall, although food was alright, the price performance balance was totally off. It unfortunately did not meet my expectations. Atmosphere is not so nice either. I have been to better restaurants with better service, better food and better ambiance for cheaper price. Gloriosa is not worth it."
"I‚Äôve been there twice - one for tasting menu and another for Burn‚Äôs Night, and I do recommend everyone to come as they are quite amazing! From cocktails, wines, foods to the coffee after meal, I cannot tell which one is the best because all of them are impressive!"
"The whole experience was amazing. The staff was very friendly and professional. The food was great, never tasted everything better. The drinks where very tasty as well. Definitely will come back.
*Thank you for the one of the best food experience of my life*"
"Received a voucher for my birthday. Was an amazing meal! Food was top notch. Well deserved of the 3 rosettes. Servers were pleasant and knowledgeable. Only thing I would say re the service (and this is me being picky), sometimes if one of us got up to the bathroom, we would come back and our plates were already served which meant we missed out on the explanations, and also clearing bread cutlery away whilst we were eating the next course. This didn't detract from the overall experience though and feel like tiny little tweaks to the service would get them to a Michelin star."
"An almost perfect dining experience, from the atmosphere, to the food to the service all impeccable. Would be lovely to have a date night here. The pizza and the pasta that we had was simply divine."
"Went here for lunch. We got the menus and it took 15 minutes for anyone to take our order. We then waited another 20 minutes for bottled beers to be brought to our table, which is far too long. Starter arrived after the main, even though we asked for it to be brought out before. Food was mediocre and we've had a lot better Italian food in Glasgow - how you can serve foccacia burnt on the outside while not properly cooked on the inside is beyond me. Overall a very mediocre experience so won't be back.

Edit: As you can see from their reply, this is their ""perfectly cooked focaccia"". I've had focaccia in lots of places and none of them served it late, burnt, oversalted and proud about it. The one I had can be described in many ways, but delicious is definitely not one of them."
"What a fantastic find. It's no wonder this restaurant is popular and very busy. The food was incredible, service fantastic and a warm authentic Italian atmosphere. Highly recommended a meal here."
"Very nice restaurant in Glasgow city centre with friendly staff and delicious food, also has a gigantic selection of wines though I did not try any on this occasion.

I would have happily given 5 stars but when I went to tip the server upon paying, I was very unimpressed to find out that a 12.5% ""gratuity charge"" had been added on the bill without anyone saying."
"My favourite Italian restaurant in Glasgow. Hands down the best. The food is excellent, great portion sizes, great variety, lovely staff, beautiful interior with lots of amazing produce to buy. The panettone I got for Christmas was sooo delicious!"
"Chilled atmosphere with cafe/deli at the front, lovely staff, great food beautifully presented. Varied menu including pizza and pasta options. Pasta on the dearer side at ¬£19 for prawn linguine but I‚Äôd say well worth it - quality ingredients and fresh flavours. Pizza also looked amazing with generous toppings."
"A nice place with a great atmosphere and wonderful food.

Had the arancini and the cacio e pepe toast and they were delicious.

The atmosphere is great for a dine in and chat and the design of the place is spacious which gives very relaxing outgoing vibes.

The servers however were not in a very good mood that day for some reason. I do not want to judge the service fully as I was there for less than an hour so I will give it a pass as it did not affect my visit as much."
"I normally look up places ahead of time for food, but we were hungry and walking back from the Art museum and this Deli appeared. We were just expecting a sandwich, but a table for two was available downstairs. I couldn't decide on what to get, but the tables to either side of us had pizza. And the server said go with the pizza. So I went with the roman sourdough pizza with smoked tomatoes, mozzarella, sausage and honey. It was amazing. Highly recommend. Just wish I had room for some dessert!"
"After submitting the final assignment, there is no better way to celebrate than a good meal. Very delicious starter, pizza and drinks. üçπ
I will come here again to try the coffee and desserts :)"
"What an amazing place, I have passed it many times but this is the first time I have been there. The food and service were excellent, so this won't be the last time.  Thanks for a lovely lunch. ps the dressing on the salad was awesome. üòÄüòÉ"
While we were very disappointed with the menu the food we had was excellent and piping hot  The staff were very attentive
"Excellent food and service and the building is very cool, loved it."
Lovely relaxing place and great prices
Thoroughly enjoyed our food. Service was attentive without being overbearing. Lovely surroundings. Highly recommended.
Sadly went in expecting the steak offer advertised in the bar only to be told it didn't apply after we ate it. Good service
"Was recommended to come here by one of the owners daughters a few years ago- finally made it and what a delight! Squeezed us in on a busy Saturday night and were attentive as friendly. Food is delicious, I love lasagne and this is up there with the best I‚Äôve had!"
"First time visit and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. The restaurant was quiet on a Monday lunchtime. The staff were lovely and took us through the various menus on offer. The food was delicious especially the prawn salad. The wine of the month was very drinkable.
Thanks to Penelope for the great service."
"It's a great modern European restaurant on the 7th floor of a hotel. You can see Glasgow City from the top. You will be served delicious food and I recommend their wine. On top of that, there is a really nice atmosphere. Enjoy a meal with your partner or a friend!"
"The view is very nice, about the same height as the buildings around the restaurant. So you have a nice side view over the city with chimneys, towers, older and more modern buildings.
After chilling outside for a while until sunset on a warm sunny day, we went inside and had dinner. Even though some of the older reviews were not so good, we enjoyed the food very much. The staff was also very nice and accommodating."
"The view is just spectacular! If you want to see Glasgow from above, this is a good spot for it! The restaurant has two small terraces where you can sit outside and have a drink. Inside it is very cozy and I liked the atmosphere. Also the staff was very friendly and very attentive, asking several times if we wanted anything else. The food was coming fast, was very nice arranged and totally yummy. Alltogether a really pleasant experience!"
"beautiful view from the 7th floors of Windows restaurant, busy place food was good. I would recommend anyone to go and enjoy their lunches and afternoon tea üçµüòä. I would go back again. It's so close to Queen Street station, too."
"We enjoyed a lovely Afternoon Tea with Prosecco here, with wonderful views over the Glasgow city centre skyline.
We were served a delicious assortment of sandwiches, brioche rolls, sausage rolls, scones with jam and clotted cream, and a yummy selection of cakes.
We can't wait to go back!"
"Beautiful restaurant, with amazing Scottish food. The scallops were unreal. All the staff were lovely. The ambience was lovely and cosy. The food is such great value for money and great portions. They also gave lots of free bread and butter! and the bread was amazing! It was corn bread and sundried tomato bread when we visited. Wish i lived in Scotland so i could revisit soon!"
"Excellent food, excellent service, a must try in Glasgow!

There‚Äôs literally nothing to complain about the food or service here! The scallops are the best I have ever had, cooked to perfection and generous portion as well! The sweetcorn pur√©e goes perfectly with the scallops, you must try this dish!!

The five spice duck is super soft and tender, the noodle are a bit salty tho. Highland Venison is delightful as well, the red cabbage in it is so tasty. They do nice cocktails here as well! Even the bread tastes so good here ü§©

The service is absolutely amazing, everyone is so welcoming and friendly, love the decor as well, excellent atmosphere, there‚Äôs plenty of seating, highly recommend this place!"
Old school dining.  This place is mind-blowingly good. No sneaky service charges and no two hour dining slot. Refreshing to say the least. Food was superb. Nice portion sizes. Cannot fault this place and cannot wait to return. A pleasant surprise.
"First time at Zizzi‚Äôs, but was not the best experience. Some of the items we ordered were great, (like the Truffle & Panceta Carbonara) but some others were quite forgettable (like the Primavera pizza, which was quite dry).

The thing we disliked the most was how long it took for the food to arrive: 4 main courses took almost an hour to arrive, and it was just a pasta dish, a single pizza, a calzone and one final chicken dish.

Overall the food is good but if you‚Äôre short on time, maybe look for another one."
"Had the garlic bread and the pizza primavera. The bread was very good but the pizza was okay at best. On a non-busy night, the wait time was over an hour. Very friendly staff, though."
"For years we've been happy with Zizzis, then got bored with their menu. The last visit was in Cardiff where we walked out after it took so long to  take our order in a not so busy restaurant.  However, yesterday we managed to order our lunch.

The calamari were good, the mushrooms on bruschetta starters also were acceptable. But just as we expected the mains to arrive  we were, rather late, told, there was no beef chianti ragu. Rush on? Err no, it was only about 12 and the three other tables weren't eating it.

Anyway, when the bolognese replacement arrived it was its usual quality, which I quite like if I'm honest. My mother was Italian, I know my pasta.  However,  The salmon? oh dear the salmon.  I tried it and gave her half my main in the end. I like salt, but my goodness, had I taken my blood pressure after eating it, the Mercury would have shot out and gone into low earth orbit. You can see from the images the carbonara was curdled with small lumps and not creamy. Was it reheated while the ragu replacement was being replaced?  Perhaps we should have rejected it on arrival...  Anyway the close up picture was what wasn't eaten in the end.  They were apologetic and a generous discount added to the bill, but that's it for Zizzis for us now.

We have a discount voucher for the Zizzi clone, Ask, let's see out that pans out next."
"Went for lunch today, was welcomed by a friendly blonde lady. The part of the restaurant we requested to sit in was unavailable due to the roof having came in which was disappointing however the food made up for that :) beautiful meal and friendly staff. Definitely would recommend üëå"
"Quite large space restaurant. Pizza was very good„ÄÇbut I like the lasagna most. Good environment. We ordered a pizza , lasagna, a dessert brownie and two glass wines. Around 50pounds.  But students have a discount if you have UNiDAYS."
food is very well presented and looks amazing on the serving dishes. we got the funfair menu for 29 quid per person on the dry January special. was worth the money and felt full after the 6 course tasting menu. all staff we came into contact with were all well informed of the menu and very helpful. would recommend.
"Amazing food!

Lovely, polite staff.

There were a few niggles with forgetting one of my vegetarian meals and mixing up one of my partner‚Äôs dishes.

But this would not stop us from going back!

Be warned they add a 12.5% service charge automatically to your bill."
"Staff were excellent as always, but the lady who helped us was so passionate and knowledgeable about the food and the associated wines. Sorry didn't get her name but she was short in height , long dark hair and her nose was peirced , She was one of the best colleagues that have served us in 6ByN and we have visited many a time . Loved her attitude ,manner and demeanor pitched at the right level .

We will be back in March for Hanoi and th3 same branch,  again one of the best ones we have visited ( Edinburgh , Nitshill and Byres )

Menu was great although if I wanted to be ultra critical ( harsh) the pork dish was a little too salty ( for our taste pallet not everyone's) and you need an extra piece of brioch with the parfait ( as I said ultra critical ).
However always a pleasurable experience and really exciting way to present food ."
"What a fantastic place?! I am sure plenty has already been written about this chain. It was a sheer delight to have a late evening (9pm) dinner. The restaurant was still full of guests. Fantastic ambience. Lovely, thoroughly thought through decor. Mixed of an old fashioned and modern to me. Great attention to detail. Extremely helpful, attentive, knowledgeable staff members. Those people work sooo hard and efficient. You are not being neglected for more than 30 seconds and at the same time it's all very subtle. Loved the service. Best of the best. The food is remarkable. Perfectly executed. Very small plates of colourful, tasteful, fresh and fragrant food. I chose 6 classic dishes and each one is a tour de force. Matching wines delicious. I WILL BE BACK! love it"
This is a tasting menu experience. It was great to try new things and I think it wasn't as expensive as expected. The wait staff are attentive and know alot about the menu. It was the funfair menu when we went. I don't eat fish so was greatful they allowed me to just switch it with the veg option no hassel.
"We decided us spontaneous for this place.
There were almost to no customers, and yet our food came stale, almost cold and tasteless.
We ordered bruschetta as an entre, it was cold, dry and stale flat bread with tomato+old lettuce leaf.
Burger buns were dry and cold. Burger patties were barely luke warm.
The fish was a tiny wrinkly dry piece, barely children's portion, with again stale flat bread.
On the positive side, service was nice and cocktails were ok."
"I was told they were awarded a Michelin 1-star rating after being open for 8 months, and I‚Äôve been curious about it. However, while the service was good, the food wasn‚Äôt; it was rather ordinary. This place failed to impress me, and I see nothing unique on the menu."
"AMAZING dinner we had at Fanny Trollopes!

All the seafood was so fresh and cooked to perfection - especially the scallops they did an absolutely fantastic job.

One thing I really love was how starters came in such a generous portion.

Added on edit: All staff were also so so nice and friendly. And that perfected our time there. Really appreciate their hospitality.

It was my first time here but I will surely turn into a regular. Highly recommended!!!"
"Super tasty food and a fun, quirky venue. Staff were great, very friendly. Starters were lovely and big portions! The scallops with black pudding were a favourite. We ended up having the specials for mains - the smoked pork belly and the fish of the day - which were both delicious. Would recommend for a special occasion or just a nice meal out."
"Really enjoyed my lunch there. Nice wee place, tasty and flavoured food. Hope to visit again to try their aubergine meals üòã"
"The best Aubergines I ever eaten.
Not sour, tasty, tender and flavored.
Nothing else to say than Amazingly Delicious.
It made my day. Thank you"
"I ate at this restaurant this evening.I ordered food and said I was allergic to gluten, they reassured me it was not a problem and they would take care of it.
They brought me a plate with aubergine and tortillas, I ate them but then, because I didn't feel well, I asked if the tortillas were gluten-free and they said they had gluten.
It is an incatteable mistake, I am celliac but I do not have a reaction that requires hospitalization, but someone else could have had a severe allergic reaction.
These mistakes should not be tolerated. Without a doubt I will not return to this restaurant."
Lovely little restaurant .Food was delicious with great choices. Lamb kebab was so tender and beautifully spiced. The Aubergine dip for starter was really interesting and flavourful. Highly recommended
"Freshly prepared, delicious food at reasonable prices for the West End. The vegetable stew with chicken and cous cous was particularly good. Attentive service from delightful staff. BYOB is a real bonus. We will be back!"
"Very tasty food at reasonable prices.

We had the 2 course Christmas menu. Chowder was creamy and full of flavour. Chicken with haggis rich, tasty and filling.

Service was excellent and friendly, even though we arrived  30mins after our table time.

Definitely recommended."
"6 stars if I could.

Definitely recommend üëå and most definitely going back soon!

We had an early Christmas meal here for a group of 12.

The staff were absolutely brilliant, good fun, and attentive.  Nothing was a problem.

The food was really tasty, delicious, and catered for everyone food preferences and intolerances. Everyone's plates were cleared, which is unusual in a group of 12.

Super food, super night, super staff."
A rare down to earth jewel and well worth the praise. Had s fabulous dinner on Friday night so had to return Saturday morning to try the breakfast ‚Ä¶ also fabulous. Thanks!
"Every bite of food was so good. Ask the staff which cut to try, they won't steer you wrong. They were very attentive and accommodating. Very cool atmos except for the large painting in the center. Definitely ask about it, though."
"Nice quiet and warm atmosphere, even on Valentine‚Äôs Day. Food was stellar, servers very friendly and attentive. Always explaining dishes and gave us a few recommendations for drinks etc. For what you get it‚Äôs priced well. It‚Äôs like a better Millar & Carter"
"Great place for dinner. Great atmosphere and great food. The starters or small plates were excellent, much better than what you might expect from a steak restaurant. The pigeon was great and very well cooked. Could easily do small plate tapas style rather than have steak.

The steaks were excellent too and a decent size. Peppercorn sauce was quite creamy, more to my wife‚Äôs liking, I like a bit more peppery heat but it was still tasty.

The carrots side was excellent, you could really taste the difference between the different types of carrot.

I thought the brownie was a bit dry and couldn‚Äôt really taste the maple or bacon flavours from the menu but it was decent enough. My wife‚Äôs baked Alaska was fantastic.

The do great inventive cocktails too.

I would definitely go back for a quality meal in Glasgow."
"My partner and I visited Porter & Rye on a Wednesday for our second Valentine's Day; we visited other steak restaurants previously but decided to try out Porter & Rye despite the slightly higher costs.

We were seated on the ground floor table, with a view into the kitchen and their meat cabinet. The service was very friendly and quick as can be.

The food was nothing short of spectacular; probably the best steakhouse I'd ever eaten at. I'm a person who swears by a medium rare steak with bare minimum seasoning, but Porter & Rye's sauces took it to a different level. There are a variety of starters, or small plates, to choose from. Beef, pork belly, veggie, venison, pigeon; choose your choice of protein, they'll serve it to you in its tastiest form. We did not get to choose the cut of steak, as we went on the meat-up Wednesday deal, however there was absolutely no complaint on the steak. The sauces were mind-blowing; we ordered the Chimichurri, Macallan & peppercorn sauce, B√©arnaise sauce, and Bone marrow & black truffle butter. The most surprising part of this experience is that I did not expect the butter to be any special but I was proven wrong. I'm no wine expert, but whatever red wine we were served, we managed a full bottle of it. Lastly, my partner wanted to end the dinner with a Scottish Coffee; this was not as abhorrent as I thought it would be but it almost wiped me out.

I will definitely revisit Porter & Rye in the future; they are a premium restaurant that serves premium quality food at a premium price (for a damn good reason). If you are a fan of steak nights, I highly recommend visiting on one of their special deal days to get the best value.

Thanks to Porter & Rye, I cannot buy Aldi steaks and cook them myself anymore as I know I'll just be disappointed in myself."
"My husband and I came here for dinner one night of our honeymoon in Scotland. The waitstaff were so pleasant, and they took the time to make little gestures like complimentary glasses of Prosecco before dinner and a ‚ÄúCongratulations on your honeymoon‚Äù display with our dessert.

Our waitress patiently answered all of our questions, and she took the time to talk to the chef when I, as a picky eater, wanted one of the desserts without half of its ingredients, and they figured out how to make a version I could happily eat.

The steak was cooked as we ordered, and my husband enjoyed his drinks. The dessert was good, maybe not great, but we were there for the main meal, and that exceeded what we were looking for."
"Excellent presentation & food was delicious
We ordered the pair and blue cheese tart & beetroot starter.
Ox Cheek was so tender, wonderful & and the salmon was delicious for the mains.
Dessert was rice pudding and apple crumble. Yeah!"
"Terrible Experience

My team and I visited for our Christmas night out and I can say without hesitation that we had the worst dining experience we have ever had.  I cannot with good conscience allow anyone else to spend their hard earned cash in a restaurant that is trading on a reputation that it clearly can no longer live up to.
A rundown of the evening:

50 minutes for a first drink (the restaurant was empty) and while I appreciate that some of us ordered cocktails, to have only one semi-trained bartender seems ludicrous. Subsequent drinks orders had to be placed by searching for a staff member and waiting an inordinately long time.

When I went to the bar to ask for a red wine glass (I had already asked a waiter but none was forthcoming) I was handed a gin glass and told just use this, it's pretty much the same shape as our red wine glasses!

Staff who were clearly untrained on the bar, waiting tables and also serving food and who very rarely came to tables to check if we needed anything

The first starters (4 bowls of lukewarm soup) arrived after over an hour. After 10 minutes another 4 bowls arrived. After a further 10 minutes, the cold salmon starters arrived. Those who had received their starter first were long finished by the time the salmon arrived.

We had selected our order weeks prior to our visit but had to reselect when we arrived as the menu had changed.

Those who chose sirloin steak diane, dauphinoise potatoes and buttered carrots, received a small fillet steak, fries, a mushroom, tomato and some had a soggy pile of rocket (except the person opposite me who only received a single rocket leaf!) The sauce had clearly been watered down to feed enough people and for some reason there were insufficient sauce boats.

Disjointed service and inconsistency in the contents of the main courses

There was zero atmosphere in the restaurant.

The table behind us eventually left as they had received no food.
The family next to us. who were seated at 8pm, were finally served their food when we left at 10.30pm

The whole experience took so long that we had limited time at the place we had booked and paid to go to after dinner

In all honesty the whole situation became farcical. It reminded me of Fawlty Towers sketch. In all my years of dining out, I have never had an experience quite like it. To take my entire staff out for a Christmas meal to thank them for their work over the year and for them to be treated like this was frankly embarrassing as an employer. As a company to fall so far of the mark, they ought to be ashamed.

The restaurant manager was clearly mortified and the duty manager refused to come and speak to us. When I spoke to the next day's duty manager, he agreed that we should be refunded so we can take our team out somewhere else. I am still waiting to be contacted about this a week later."
"My partner and I went for a celebration meal and were broadly very happy with the experience. Both of our starters (smoked salmon and scallops) were excellent and we both enjoyed our steaks, however both felt that they were a grade overcooked relative to what we had ordered. All of the staff were excellent and generally I would highly recommend, but would suggest perhaps being a touch  conservative  in a steak order"
Visited tonight 27/01/24 for dinner. Greeted and seated by friendly blonde female. The food was amazing. Steak was cooked to perfection. I liked that they had a good selection on the set menu which was very reasonably priced. Waiting staff couldn't have been more helpful. Will definitely be back. Thanks for a nice dining experience.
"Food was amazing, the fillet steak with onion rings were excellent and my partner was very pleased too with the rib eye. The staff were very friendly and made our dining experience one to remember. Prices were a little steep compared to other restaurants but I can't fault the food, presentation or taste as was delicious üòã"
"Tried this a few times for lunch. Food is ok and quick (if available )but they never seem to have any ready. Pasta is always needing to be made, salmon is never ready and usually ""5 mins"" which turns into 10.

Has potential to be better  but it seems the owner is letting it down. Very bossy and demanding on her staff and service could be better. Staff look like they are being held against their will. Not sure what the story is.

Taste wise it is ok when you compare v cost (city centre pricing)."
"OK for a quick lunch but... service is lacking . We were bundled together with another order and rushed through the process, so much so we had to ask if we could get some of the toppings.  Great idea but the meat and fish sit looking either dry or swimming in the prep boxes."
They added a deal to itison to attract new customers then decided to close for ‚Äúrenovations‚Äù. Seen all the bad reviews prior to buying the deal but thought it worth the risk at ¬£5 for a meal + drink. Walked all the way up there when I was in glasgow for the day to find them shut. Why agree to offering new customers an itison deal then close during the same time period. I guess the way this place is managed IS just as bad as how the other reviewers say it is
"Owner doesn‚Äôt pay her staff, is quick to substitute ingredients for cheaper lower quality alternatives and is consistently rude to customers/staff while walking around the store with bare feet even in food prep areas. I would not recommend this restaurant as the food is overpriced and quality is lacking."
Super quick service and a decent lunch for the price. Didn‚Äôt realized that the server was going to mix my dish (was quite excited for it unmixed) so that is something to note for next time.
"A lovely small restaurant tucked away on a quiet street close to the city centre. I had lunch with friends and we all enjoyed our food. The waitress went out of her way to accommodate what we wanted, which was a bit different to the usual order of courses. They have a good selection of wines by the glass   and wine to suit all budgets. We won't leave it so long until we go back again."
"I loved everything about this experience. The food was amazing, and the staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Plenty of options both food and drink. Clean restaurant and toilets.
Best tiramisu I've had."
Great place for a bite to eat. They were able to squeeze us in at short notice. Bruschetta starter was really nice. Main was good but not outstanding.. Desert (homemade tiramisu) was really good. Service was friendly and not overbearing.
"Since we were attending a concert,  we booked this restaurant about 3 months prior to our event and since there was 5 of us wanted to be guaranteed a table.

The menu choices were good, I went with the old classics however my friends all  chose different things and they all looked excellent and with empty plates at the end obviously tasted excellent üëå

Reasonable prices for the food and drinks we had.

Will definitely be back if I'm in Glasgow again. üòÄ"
"According to the recommendation on the Internet, I came to this restaurant for my lunch in Glasgow. This restaurant has a unique set menu during lunch time, two courses is ¬£19.95, three courses is ¬£22.95. Because I don't want to eat dessert, I just order a Oven Baked Lamb Stovies for starters and a Ardnamurchan Estate Braised Wild Venison Stew for mains. The starters - Lamb with a piece of cheddar cheese stewed very soft, and it's delicious with its tangy tomato flavor and baked aroma. The mains - venison stew is rich in side dishes, and the mushrooms and potatoes have a unique taste when paired with the venison. The only downside was that the venison wasn't tender enough, but that was the problem with the venison and not with the restaurant processing it poorly.

I also ordered an oyster, which cost ¬£3. If ordered 6 oysters, it would be ¬£15.  The oyster has a small size but absolutely fresh. Worth to try.

Overall, this restaurant serves very good food.  If you come to Glasgow, please come and try this restaurant!"
"We've been on vacation in Scotland for 10 days and while we've had some great meals,  this one topped them all!!  The Cullen Skink, to quote my Glaswegian born spouse was 'the best I've ever had'.  The fish & chips and the sirloin with peppercorn sauce were fantastic.   The sticky toffee pudding was superb!  The wine list is good.  The cocktails were lovely - try the Orange Chocolate Espresso Martini!  The service was outstanding - thank you Grier!"
"Staff was very nice and attentive!

Food: The scallops were super fresh and delicious! The goat cheese salad was also quite nice. The lambo shank wasn‚Äôt that great - the dried out broccoli was nice though. The best was the chestnut risotto and the sticky toffee pudding. Those two dishes I‚Äôd recommend in a heartbeat!"
"I asked for a medium rare steak, but I got medium well. I wasn't happy about it

It was my wifes birthday and the first time Scottish restaurant . It was a beautiful and very nice experience . The cocktails were nice
Espresso matini made my wife's day .

The fish soup was fantastic
Haggis was beautiful and earthy

My wife's venison was cooked to perfection

Sticky toffee pudding was to die for. However, there was a pitt of date in one of the bites.

In all, it was good"
"Must visit!

incredible service. Enjoyed the most delicious Xmas dinner here. The staff were excellent and supporting big group bookings and the process of organising with them was super smooth. The food was divine! Roast was perfection, bean cassoulet was wow. Credits to the chef and to the wonderful staff. A special thanks especially to Callum who made the meal out extra special. I‚Äôll be back and recommending the left bank to anyone looking for delicious food with excellent service in the west end"
"My colleague recommended this brunch cafe to me, so I decided to drop in for a quick meal. The staff were exceptionally friendly. I ordered a bank breakfast and a pot of breakfast tea. Overall, the food was good, but the mushrooms and bean were too cold. Additionally, I wasn't provided with any cutlery at the beginning of my meal, so I had to request a fork and knife from the staff later on. Despite these minor inconveniences, I might still recommend the place overall."
"Another anniversary dinner with my lovely wife. This is the first time we have visited the west end restaurant as we normally book with the one near George square. Food was good, a few things were amiss with the meatballs as the individual balls were tough. But other than that a great atmosphere with all the Spanish touches surrounding us. The service was great with the only nip pick was we had to constantly try and find out waiter for drinks. He seamed to be fully concentrating on the larger tables."
Got vouchers for Christmas last year and finally went. Good selection of food and reasonable prices. We got the sharing platter as a starter and it was delicious. Got the specials for our mains a bit disappointed that you had to order rice or noodles separately
"First time I've been .
This was a 1st date
We arrived early so sat next to the bar waiting on our table .
Very busy evening

Female server was informative & attentive.

Toilets down steep stairs struggled a bit with high heels on however
Very clean .

The steak was cooked to perfection peppercorn sauce  potatoes & fries tasty.
Could not fault it

The white zinfadel (Rose) was a good accompaniment to the food.

Don't know the cost as my date paid however the food was worth it .

Would come back.."
"Stunning building, grand dining room and plenty of space between tables. Pleasant atmosphere and our server was lovely. Now the food. Possibly one of, if not, the best fillet steaks I've ever had. Also this was on a Sunday so it was about ¬£35 per person for 3 courses, so good. Also the desert was delicious, the ice cream with mango sorbet and raspberry compote, comes in a shell of mango chocolate, highly recommend. Also the onion loaf is their answer to onion rings and I'm converted!"
"Overrated and disappointing experience.

Positive: Service from staff is excellent. Atmosphere is fantastic. Food comes out very prompt compared to most places.

Negative: The food is not the best that it so likes to boast about. Starters are tiny and had better steaks elsewhere (additionally; I asked for medium rare and got rare, partner asked for medium well and got medium). The main also is very sparse for a typical steak dinner, no vegetables as you need to choose between chips OR veg, why?! The most desolate steak dinner I have ever seen."
"The perfect date. Loads of prawns in the starter and our steaks were cooked beautifully, the food came out really quickly too. Long island ice tea was a 10/10! Shout out to our server Mags who was fantastic, really friendly, warm and very informative. Can't wait to return."
"Luxurious fine dining experience in Glasgow. The food was great, and the service fantastic. However, be ready to spend a pretty penny, we spent over 350 pounds for 7 people. We thought that Halibut and the Monk Fish were fantastic, although we would have preferred a tad more Halibut on our dish considering the high price tag. Overall a good experience."
Loved the food. Really tasty fish soup to start. Sea bream was excellent. Good choice of wines to accompany our meal. Pleasant setting and friendly staff. Keen to get back again soon.
"As someone who isn't necessarily the biggest fan of pancakes I was blown away with how much I enjoyed my visit on pancake day. The staff were excellent, the food was clearly made all in house and everything ate table of 4 had looked fantastic.

I went for savoury pancakes with spicy chicken, avocado, Pico de Gallo, sour cream and avocado and it was simply sublime. I would go back in an instant.

Fantastic place and run incredibly well. Managers and kitchen staff obviously care about the place succeeding."
"Stopped in last month for our last breakfast meal while on our honeymoon and wow-- talk about going out with a bang! It was absolutely delicious! Wish we lived closer and could visit more frequently! The staff was wonderful as well, so kind, personable and attentive + the environment was cute and welcoming."
"Clean and trendy inside and a pleasant atmosphere all round.  Service was very good and always with a smile.  Pancakes are delicious - just beware they are very filling!  The Christmas special of a turkey stack was a nice touch and the pancakes went very well with it, bit like having Yorkshire Pudding with a difference.  Will be back again soon."
I ordered the grilled aubergine stack but with gluten free pancakes. Pancakes were v good and the toppings had such a great mix of flavours. My partner had a side dish of spicy chicken fries but changed it to Chipotle Mayo- it was a huge portion. Both left very satisfied üòÑ
"Came for a late brunch and had my first savoury pancake. I was super happy with my choice of pesto egg stack (sans mushrooms). Delicious and everyone else was really happy with their food too. Even the non-gluten pancakes, which I also tried and we're a bit chewier than with gluten, perhaps also because they're vegan."
We were recommended the restaurant and were not disappointed.  From the welcome and service from Tricia.  TO the food and wine. Everything was excellent.  Trivia gave us great advice on what we ordered and she was spot on. The chateaubriand for two was perfect. Perhaps one of the most delicious steaks I've ever had.
"At Mini Grill in Glasgow, you can expect both outstanding steak and impeccable service. The steak offerings are simply exceptional, prepared to perfection and bursting with flavor. The attention to detail in cooking and presentation is evident in every bite. The service provided by the staff is equally impressive ‚Äì attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. This winning combination of great steak and top-notch service makes Mini Grill a must-visit destination for those seeking an unforgettable dining experience."
"Food and drink were good as I expected.
But the outside space was too cold due to wind, there was no heater and no more blanket."
Great atmosphere.  Was a little cramped getting to & from our table based on how others were seated.  Meatballs were okay.  Chocolate fondue was so yummy!  Visit after dark as the lights are beautiful.
"Authentic Italian in downtown Glasgow.  They took our party quickly on a busy night without a reservation.  The service was attentive through a group effort.  The food was delicious and truly authentic.  The minestrone soup was perfect.  Fresh vegetables, served hot, with just the right amount of salt.  The slices of haggis and black pudding was surprisingly tasty for my first time.  Don‚Äôt ask what it is made of, just try it and you will find an unusual, but pleasant flavor and texture.  The medallion of veal fillet alla Milanese was a tender, hearty portion of veal pounded thin, coated in light breading, and served hot.  Delicious from the first bite to the last.  The table next to me ordered the lyonnaise potatoes and they looked so good I had to order them as well.  They were superb and tasted as good as they looked.  Welcoming, charming place with more than reasonable pricing especially on the alcohol.  Must visit if you like Italian."
"Went to Piccolo mondo for a two course lunch + drink for two with an itison voucher.
Haven't been here for years and didn't disappoint. Staff were very friendly, and the service was first class. The food was great, fresh, and very tasty. Definitely be back. ‚ù§Ô∏èüëå‚úîÔ∏è"
"Just had lunch there. The most amazing food I've ever had. The staff was also very nice. I would go 7 days a week. The food was so good I almost cried‚ù§. My friends and I had the pasta bolognese, the lasagna and the grilled seafood platter. Very lovely!"
Service was inattentive. Did not provide steak knives for venison. Server disappeared for smoke break. Banana bread for dessert tasted uncooked. Scallops were properly cooked. Serving sizes were misery. Disappointing experience.
First time visit to Roma Mediterranean Restaurant and was actually surprised at how big it is inside. It's a bit like a Tardis! Hadn't booked but there were plenty of tables available. Nice decor and the atmosphere was pretty good. Nice little booths where you can sit and chat easily without being overpowered by noise from elsewhere. Food was all good and very tasty. The only downside for me was the automatic addition of a 10% gratuity to the bill. I usually like to decide for myself if the service was worthy of a tip. Overall though I would recommend it as the food was really nice. üëçüèª
Really nice restaurant. Service was very good and I enjoyed the food.
"I went here for my birthday dinner with my wife. Booked it on 5pm deal. Staff acknowledge this straight away. Got a lovely table brought out our wine and asked if we wanted some water. We ordered starters and an amazing steak. I had the Diane sauce which was amazing and my wife had the red wine sauce. I would defo go back. Tip is already put on your bill. The 5pm deal was 2 course Sunday to Wednesday with a bottle of wine ¬£49.25.
Thank you"
"Excellent food, beautiful interior and great service. The food was ready fast. The only complaint is that the table surface was sticky, even the napkins were stick to the table because of stickiness.

We tried chips with Halloumi, Lamb Moussaka which were both good and Lamb chops, the lamb chops was one of the best chops I‚Äôve ever had."
"Food was amazing. Highly recommend the feta tempura, was sooo good. The gyros was great also. The music was good and the staff were really friendly. Will return again"
"Lovely high quality Greek food from a very broad menu. We were a group of 6 celebrating a birthday.
Service was very friendly from very polite and attentive staff.
Wasn't cheap and the wine was a bit over priced.
We were in on a Sunday afternoon in January,  so it wasn't busy, bit quiet, no great atmosphere.
All good though. Really enjoyed it and will definitely go back."
First visit. Will definitely be going back. Food was delicious. Staff were lovely.
"My family and I popped in for a lunch today to celebrate my mums birthday and it didn‚Äôt disappoint.
The staff worked really hard today despite the challenges of the day, and we left a ¬£15 tip to thank them, and to to help show some appreciation for how they handled the day. I‚Äôll definitely be going back, we‚Äôre a notoriously a fussy family with exploring new foods, so it was lovely to eat so many new things we enjoyed.
Manager was such a lovely man and we wish the staff the best"
With no booking we only had a short wait for a table for 2 of us and a pram even though it was very busy on a Friday afternoon. Small menu but food was absolutely amazing. Good portion sizes and service was very quick.
"Food is delicious. Service very fast, lovely decor and surroundings. My only complaint is that the waiting staff tended to linger and continually come over to the table which was put people on edge, I noticed other tables around me saying the same thing. Folk just want to be left to eat in peace so this would be my only bit of feedback."
"30 min waiting was worth it. One of the best selection of pasta, amazing service, perfectly cooked dishes and delicious desserts. A perfect place for Italian food !"
"Best pasta I've ever eaten in my life. Quick, efficient, no frills, no substitutions, absolutely mint at what they do. Table of 6 in and out in 45 mins, including the wait for the table."
"We were a big group of 9, so we went early around 12 noon and were seated within a few minutes (it got crowded very soon after). The place is big, casual and gets noisy during a busy service, but that's part of the vibe. The menu had around 10 pastas to choose from. The pasta itself was ok, not al dente enough to my liking, but this seems to be the case with some freshly made pasta. The sauce was a bit tart but rather tasty, without being overly seasoned with herbs. Flavours are quite similar to homemade pastas I've had in Italy. Overall a good experience, but don't go with terribly high expectations, you won't get top standard luxury fare here."
"I tried their prawn masala with biryani rice and fish pakora, and 2 cups of tea. Portion is generous, I order one meal for two person. Service is also good."
"We were somewhat disappointed with the standard of most of the food. While naans were hot, crisp and generously sized a dish of Chole was rancid. Lamb biryani was satisfactory as was a lamb curry. Everything was over spiced and too salty - an old trick intended to drive drink sales. Service was friendly and attentive though, which was nice."
"Amazing plentiful presentation of food in a beautiful restaurant on a beautiful street. Excellent service as well. Highly recommend the juicy Dosas and the haggis pakoras as starters. The mains are waaaaaay bigger than I‚Äôm used to getting  - I would say one serves two. So get two and take home leftovers! The Lamb sharab masti was especially delicious. The naans are also waaaaaay bigger than I‚Äôm used to and also way more flavorful and expertly baked. The garlic naan certainly doesn‚Äôt skimp on the garlic and the sweeter peshwari naan quickly became the highlight of the table. The table behind us ordered what I believe is the giant naan and if you‚Äôre going to try to impress somebody ‚Ä¶ order that. Excellent and unusual presentation! Many thanks to our server, Diksh, who was beyond hospitable and informative."
"The staff were so attentive,  present ,but not pushy.  The cleanliness of the restaurant and the toilets just added to the experience. The assurance from the staff on the food choices reassured you of your choice. Good portions and quality throughout."
"First visit in a long time,one of Glasgow West ends most enduring asian restaurants .
Tasty  pakora, unusually served in a metal cage for starters.  My friend and i both had delicious Patia dishes. The tangy sauce tasting exactly  like a patia should .This was accompanied  by excellent  Garlic Nan and fried Rice. The bill for two was ¬£45. The decor is how it should be, traditional  with beautiful  wall murals. Staff were very attentive and friendly. Situated in the  historic Ashton lane, very close to Hillhead Underground. This is a dining experience  worth seeking out."
"Always love coming to Las Iguanas. Great cocktails, fab food, although one of my favourite sides has now changed. Usually get the roasted cauliflower, which is dusted and roasted to perfection with spices, however on this visit, the cauliflower is now tiny little pieces dunked in a thick stodgy batter. So your getting half the amount of cauliflower and a bug bowl full of batter, to be honest it's unrecognisable as cauliflower.Very disappointing, these dishes are expensive for what they are, but usually worth it for the flavour, but not in this case. Bring back the original recipe. Cocktails amazing as and service with a smile from our bearded server, who couldn't do enough x"
"Delicious food in a chic, warm, slightly nautical environment. Great 80s music playing most of the night. And the service is top notch! Staff went above and beyond to accommodate our party and make us feel welcome. We can‚Äôt wait to return!"
"Truly amazing place! It‚Äôs not hard to get a space here since I made my reservation just today. Classic decoration and friendly staffs, go for the tasting menu with the scallop for an extra fee.

The snacks at the beginning are great, fresh oyster and soft flatbread. After that, king fish, scallop, octopus.. everything within the menu is super delicious and impressive.

Besides the food they also have an amazing wine pairing, the fruity Sauvignon blanc with a feeling of tropical fruit really got me. Also don‚Äôt forget to get yourself an after dinner cocktail and a small bite snack.

The one thing I feel is not quite okay is that one of their staffs seems to always be in a rush, which would give people a feeling of intense."
"We visited here on a Wednesday night and were very happy with our choice.
Firstly, the restaurant itself is very nice inside, very well kept. Background music was good but not overly loud. Service was attentive but not intrusive.
Onto the food, we can honestly say that everything we ordered was very good. Well presented and tasty. The ¬£1 oysters were an added bonus, this runs at certain times, so best checking what times to take advantage. Not overly complicated or busy menu, and specials were great too

Overall, a great place for seafood. Highly recommend."
Creative and top class seafood menu. Great ambience and service. ¬£1 per oyster from 4-7pm everyday!
"We had such a wonderful time we have already recommended the restaurant to several friends. Our server, Lauren I think, was brilliant. She gave great recommendations for the food and drink. Food was incredible, one of the best meals we have had and definitely the best seafood we've had. We will be back ASAP!"
"Went to try the Mexican food in Glasgow. Amazing taste, Great Prices and Just sufficient portions. Decor is amazing, staff is friendly and courteous. Definitely recommended."
"Fantastic meal following a long day at work. I have the chicken tinga tacos and shredded beef tostados. Both were excellent and left just the right amount of tingle on the tongue.

Espresso martini was also a delight. I would really struggle to find fault with my visit as staff were also excellent"
"This place looks really nice, but I don‚Äôt think that food is that great. Prices are okay, but I ordered Chicken Chimichanga and it was quite bland. Virgin Margaritas are pretty small. Also, they add 10% service even if you‚Äôd order only drinks and be in a group that is Less than 5 people (most places are adding 10% when group is bigger than 5 people, so I was really surprised)."
"Probably the best mexican restaurant I've been to in Glasgow, well apart from Bibis but that's a different experience and not central.

Foods really good, service is excellent and it's a good atmosphere.  Nothing to fault really.  Been twice and wouldn't hesitate to go back

Still not as good as taco van in LA tho ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Went here after a friend recommended it, and it was during the cycle race so super busy. Waitress was super nice, front of staff guy lacked a bit of personality. Atmosphere and food was delicious. I found 4 tapas plates too much for me to eat, but they happily put it in a takeaway box for me to finish off later. The family & I will eat here again when we are in Glasgow next time."
"Stopped here for an impromptu dinner with friends and was so glad we did. We tried the Pollo Carbonara, Risotto Con Cozze e Gamberetti, Calabria and a Mochaccino. All the food was amazing and the service was warm and quick. The  Risotto was our favourite and the decor and ambience made the whole experience even more enjoyable."
"Lovely restaurant, with a beautiful cherry blossom tree in the centre. Food was absolutely delicious, had the arancini balls and tapas style pizza. Strawberry daiquiri mocktail was huge and very tasty. Place was very cosy with a nice vibe and the staff were helpful."
A beautiful restaurant with a cherry blossom tree in the middle of it. Went for a business dinner and enjoyed the ambience of the restaurant and of course the food. Having just returned from two weeks in Sicily it felt like I was still on holiday with the huge selection the menu had to offer. I'm not a local but would definitely visit again when I'm next in Glasgow.
"First of all I have to say it is a nice place to go and enjoy the atmosphere.

Secondary, the food taste lovely but overwhelmed on fat containings.

At last the reason they get one stars on service is because the nice lady took our order was very welcoming. However, the other two staffs ignored our enquiries are the issue. Thanks to the manager  who decided to issue ""one"" free dessert between the two of us after forgetting our main course after 40 mins, that's the only reason I'd give them any rating. At last we got the dish on the table quick enough for us to pack them up for our next revenue."
"Brilliant place! Really busy and you can see why. Staff were attentive and knowledgeable and the service was quick but didn't feel rushed. Food was so tasty and hot and fresh and special shout out to the Italian host, nothing was too much trouble for him and he clearly runs a great restaurant. Can't wait to go back"
"Overall a pleasant dining experience. Dishes were hit and miss. Snails were rather blend and tasteless, raw oysters were small but tasty and fresh, scallops were good, however the ribeye steak was the highlight of all. Tender juicy well aged and perfectly grilled, one of the best in town. Most staff are friendly and attentive, we were late due to having too much fun in another cocktail bar prior to coming for dinner, the front door lady was not happy and you can tell from her face and her tone of voice, that made us felt uncomfortable and guilty, there were many empty tables and wasn‚Äôt that full while we arrived but she was putting on a wide smile when we left."
"Visited over the weekend with friends, we were hosted by Nicole who was absolutely spot on. She went above and beyond for us to ensure we were able to get exactly what it was we were looking for. Her colleague Andrew was great too. The food was great, there was something for everyone, drinks were cracking especially the cocktail - 'Spectre'. Thank you both & to the rest of the team for a great experience."
"I booked a table for a birthday dinner at 7pm on a Sunday. We had 5 starters and 4 mains. A bottle of Prosecco to share, two cocktails and a pint. The food is delicious and the table service is excellent. Total bill was ¬£153 excluding a tip. Very good value for quality dining."
"We dined here today for lunch and we‚Äôre so glad that we picked Elia!
Location is very central and is opposite the Christmas Market on George Square. We had a friendly greeting and were seated straight away even though the restaurant was busy. We opted for the Meze for Two which consisted of starters, mains, desert and coffee all for ¬£58. The dishes were all chefs choice apart from the desert which we could choose. We enjoyed every single dish and got to try things that we may never have ordered. Great service from the waiting staff too. Overall very happy with our visit and will come back."
"Beautiful, fresh food. I've been wanting to try here for a while and so glad we finally did. Service was good and we were given complimentary bread, olives and oil, which was nice. My only complaint would be for starters we ordered hummus and tzatziki which came on big plates, we were given 1 pitta between 2 people. I feel for the amount in each starter we could have done with a pitta each. We would definitely return."
"You can smell the delicious food before entering the restaurant!

We tried the lunch menu which have a good amount of options already. The dolma is really tasty, so are the tzatziki with pita bread. I had the lamb souvlaki and its sooo tender, cooked literally to perfection, the portion size is pretty big, thoroughly enjoyed that. My friend ordered the Smyrneika, the meatballs are nice but a bit salty, the sauce is amazing tho.

The service is great, they had a large menu and plenty seatings, will definitely come back to try more food! Highly recommend this place!"
"One of my favourite dining establishments and maybe the best Greek in Glasgow. Terrific food, reasonable prices, and excellent service. Worth booking."
"Osteria is located at 17 John Street, Glasgow (within Merchant City).  It's a 10 to 15 minute walk from Glasgow Central.

The food we ordered was lovely. We had the chicken burger with fries and spaghetti carbonara (the carbonara was quite creamy), with bruschetta classica. For dessert, cheesecake of the day (it was lemon, very soft and airy). We also had a banana split. Big thumbs up!

There were two nice members of staff alternatively waiting on people. The restaurant layout itself is very welcoming. The main part is probably the best area for people who may have any mobility problems. To the left and right of the bar, going up a few steps, you'll find seating. There is a very spacious disabled toilet located to the right of the bar area. It was spotless.

Accessibility to the upstairs part of the restaurant and the ladies and gents toilets is via a spiral staircase. Again, the toilet facilities were gleaming.

I think this restaurant may be dog friendly as well.

Continuing on a canine theme, the S.O.T.B cocktails were the puppy's bow wows!!!! I would go to this restaurant again."
"üçïüçù Stepped into this Italian joint Osteria in Glasgow, that had me feelin' like I just stumbled into a scene from The Godfather!

üíº The atmosphere was as authentic as a Sicilian grandma's secret recipes, and the joint was bigger than Don Corleone's empire! üíºüèõÔ∏è They've got more pizza and pasta variations than mob bosses have aliases ‚Äì capisce? üçïüçù And let me tell ya, the music was thumpin' like a beat-up Cadillac cruisin' down Mulberry Street! üöóüé∂

Now, the cheesecake, fuhgeddaboudit! It was as big as a suitcase full of cash, but sweet enough to give a rival sugar rush!

But let's talk 'bout that colossal calzone ‚Äì it was so massive, I half expected a violin case to be smuggled inside! üéª And the price? Let's just say it's an offer you can't refuse! üí∏ Now, the food prep time, it was quicker than a getaway car at midnight ‚Äì 14 minutes flat, no funny business. ‚è≤Ô∏èüåÉ"
"I came here the other week with a friend. My only qualm was I couldn't finish my main course because I wasn't feeling well! Staff were attentive and helpful, food was lovely and reasonably priced. Will definitely be back"
"Wonderful Italian restaurant! The food was great, the staff were attentive and the place itself is lovely. Would highly recommend."
"Lovely little Italian restaurant in the heart of Glasgow city centre. Very polite staff and very good food. Fast service coupled by home made Italian food, what more do you want. Also recent award winners! Give it a go, you won't be disappointed."
"That Shetland mussels was a must have. The flavor was just insanely good. Good portion size too!

The steak sandwich was fantastic too!

That Burger though was slightly on the dry side unfortunately. The chips were cut in special shape to enhance taste and well cooked.

Great friendly service! Will definitely come back again!"
"Visited The Citizen for a belated Christmas work meal and it did not disappoint!
The staff were very welcoming and friendly. I went for the Korean Crispy Chicken starter - absolutely delicious, full of flavour!
I had the Harissa Lamb Shank for main and so glad I did! The lamb fell off the bone, there was so much meat! The truffle mash was delicious and the honey roast carrots & crispy onions tasted delicious!
Enjoyed the meal so much, I went for a dessert, the chocolate and baileys cheesecake. Delicious end to a lovely meal!
Would definitely be back and would recommend."
"We had our works Christmas night out here. The atmosphere is great. A lot of these places will blare out loud music. But this was kept a low volume here. So you can engage in conversations while the music just soothes in background.

I ordered the haggis-turkey-sticky toffee pudding. All excellent choices. Turkey was quite juicy.

Would definitely come here again."
"Nice restaurant with good atmosphere. Variety of drinks, good and fast service.
Different options of meat, chicken, and fish plates."
My favourite. I've been many times and never once has there been the slightest thing to complain about. The food and drinks are of very high standard and the service you get is always the absolute best. I just love it here.
Really lovely food and quick service. Would defo go back and try more starters. Had three courses but didn't feel bloated or too full. Was just the perfect amount. Staff were lovely.
Kate loved the vegetarian options and the clay pot aubergine was melt in the mouth. Staff were really attentive. I highly recommend the soft shell crab which had a warm heat to them that left my lips tingling. Perfect spot for a lovely meal.
"This is one of the best Asian meals I've ever had. The plum ribs were an absolute standout - the best I've ever had! Can also recommend their twist on a Pina colada.

Can highly recommend this place, especially their dim sum options."
"Amazing Asian fusion food with fabulous veggie/vegan offerings. Light, crisp, differentiated flavours with some of the best deep fried tofu I've ever had. Non alcoholic Heineken and tasty ¬£5 mocktails as well. A small place that was packed all night so book. Excellent service with water constantly topped up: most responsible."
"Hadn't been to the restaurant in about 4 years and had totally forgotten how good it was! Amazing food, full of flavour and great selection of dishes to choose from. Staff were great and very attentive. We ordered quite a few dishes as there was so much we wanted to try, everything was delicious. My beef fillet main was üëå"
"I recently visited the Hug and Pint for the first time [07/02/24] for the GhostWoman gig.
The upstairs bar has a wide selection of mullets and moustaches.
It also serves alcohol and vegan food.
The toilets are clean. The staff are friendly. And vice versa.
The downstairs venue is small. The sound was good.
There are also tables outside which might be enjoyable if it wasn't a February night in Scotland.
I thoroughly enjoyed my night out and would recommend this venue."
"One of the bests restaurants I have been to. I reserved seats online before coming for a family of 4...The ambience was great...warm cosy feeling. The waiter who attended to us was fantastic in his approach and very professional. Appetizer came very quickly and main meal followed in good time. You could see attention to detail from the way the food was presented. There was a kids menu with a 3 course meal for 10pounds....which I thought was very good and filling for the kids. My steak and the Mrs were perfect. No complaints whatsoever. I have now received offers from them for a Tomahawk Thursday and look I just have to go back. In all, we spent ¬£125 for all our meals which was made up of ¬£20 of the kids meal. So that gives an idea of what it cost both adults for their meal. No wine bottles..just a glass."
"A large group of us came to The Butchershop for dinner. Our friend, who got married that weekend, had recommended this place as he frequents it with his (now) wife!

It was superb. The wine was incredible, the food came out at perfect temperatures, and the wait staff was attentive and accommodating. We did stay back for an after-dinner drink; we moved over to the bar area so they can seat another reservation. I had an Old-Fashioned and it was made perfectly!

I have to say, their onion rings are delicious!!! There's also vegetarian and gluten free options available, which is lovely!"
Amazing atmosphere and staff were amazing? Kendall was serving us and was superb!
"We were looking forward to our meal at the Butchershop but it was really disappointing. We had ribeye steaks with chips, some sides and dessert. All I can say that the food was edible but didn‚Äôt justify ¬£150. Even the chips lacked flavour, and my rare medium steak was hard to chew. I don‚Äôt know if we got unlucky for ordering a la carte on a Tuesday? We won't be returning."
"Amazing restaurant with fabulous food. The black pudding scotch egg was one of the best starters I've ever had... just delicious.  The steaks were cooked to perfection, with a choice of sauces and sides.  Desserts very tasty.  All in all a great experience.  My new favourite restaurant."
"The food was amazing, the sides were big portions

The bread & butter was the best we have ever had

The desserts were so enjoyable

The staff went way beyond with their kindness compared to any other restaurant we have been to"
"I would really like to thank Miller & Carter for our anniversary dinner.  We managed to get a lovely booth at 8pm at night on valentines day.                                       Our server Jess was extremely helpful.   As my wife wasn't sure what stake to have .  But Jess guided her through the options & helped her choose the perfect stake .
Our stakes were done to perfection as always & gave them back clean plates üòã.
The place has a lovely atmosphere  &  always clean & tidy.
Just to say a special thanks to Jess for organising a lovely sweet for my wife .
With Happy Anniversary written on her plate .   It made her feel even more special ü§ó."
Good potential atmosphere was ruined by lots of screaming kids. Our waitress was excellent. Saturday lunchtime is best avoid if you don't have kids. Maybe we were just unlucky.
"Incredible pasta with incredible speed! I went on a Monday night, around 5 pm and only had to wait 5 minutes to be seated - speedy! Then I ordered drinks and pasta for me and my friend (the waitress was very lovely) and within 10-15 minutes of waiting, our food arrived - super speedy!! It was so delicious, I could only think about this incredible meal for the next 4 days following our visit. Oh, and I would highly recommend trying their affogato; it‚Äôs unlike any other I‚Äôve had before! Sweet and smooth with a gelato-like texture without any hint of bitterness, to die for. I hope I find myself in Glasgow again to pop by for another experience at Sugo!"
"Incredible. Still can't get over the atmosphere, food quality and service here. Loved every bit. We stumbled across the restaurant as we walked the mural trail. It looked busy so we thought a late lunch would work as we had our bags. It was still busy but the staff were more than capable. Highly Highly recommend. We all loved our food. We even asked the owner if they would consider setting up in Dublin."
"I really liked this place. It's nice, cosy and well decorated on the inside. The food was very well presented and most importantly was delicious. I tried the gnocchi and I have to say it was something else, would highly recommend. Shrimp Mac n cheese was average. The staff were delightful and made the whole experience better. Great stuff. Given the prices though I would expect nothing less - it's all rather expensive."
"Nice staff but it‚Äôs really expensive for super small portions !! What you see in the picture (the two tiny scallops) were 18¬£ ! I‚Äôm still hungry we had to go to Mac Donald‚Äôs‚Ä¶ oops‚Ä¶

*Edit : I wrote the above review when I was hungry but I now understand the pricing better, thanks for taking the time to answer !"
"I got to celebrate my birthday at The Finnieston and had an absolutely incredible dining experience.
First I should emphasise that you need to get a reservation. Even if you think it's going to be a slow day or want to try your luck, eat your pride and reserve the table. We watched lots of people get very sadly turned away.
Also, this place is dog friendly so bring your well behaved companion for other customers to baby talk to.
The service here was so good. I was torn between different dishes and the server very kindly suggested an off the menu seafood platter. It had everything I was wanting to try from the entrees, but on a platter. The portion was incredibly generous for myself and my partner and the accompanying chips were fried perfectly. We also got a spiced Panna Cotta which was great and I thoroughly enjoyed the cocktail selection. We'll definitely be back and The Finnieston has a permanent spot on my list of recommendations for visitors."
"The food was quite tasty but the portions were small, in my opinion. So, I think it is slightly overpriced for what you get (I might just be biased though as I haven't been to many seafood restaurants in the UK).

The table was sticky, which gave the impression it hadn't been cleaned properly.

The atmosphere of the place was quite nice though, and the staff was friendly."
"My partner and I tried this restaurant as we couldn‚Äôt decide where and what to eat on a Wednesday night. They have the 2 or 3 course dinner menu which is absolutely smashing with great prices (less than ¬£19 for 2 course). We had the grilled asparagus and prawn cocktail salad, Turkey with cranberry sauce and Chicken with mushroom sauce.. To our surprise, we love every dish here. We had a wonderful dinner, the food served were all fresh, delicious and generous in portions. Servers are all prompt and attentive. The ambience here is warm, inviting and authentic.
Definitely will bring friends here."
"Basic Italian restaurant .
Food was ok.
The restaurant is a little bit old but with lot‚Äôs of Italian items :)"
"Busy Saturday night but the staff couldn't have been more accommodating. Food was delicious, my two year old loved his pasta. We couldn't resist trying some ourselves.
Melt in the mouth salmon, house wine was really really nice. Looking forward to going back."
"Myself and two friends were looking for somewhere to eat last night (it was a saturday) and stumbled upon Pulcinella.
Even though we didn't have a reservation, they found a table for us, and the managed was very welcoming.
The waiters were all very polite and efficient with one of taking a photo for us as we couldn't manage to get all of us in the photo.
We all ordered our 2 courses and when the food came I have to say it was some of the best I've tasted. I had bruschetta for a starter, and it was so fresh and bursting with tomato flavour. For my main I had a pizza and it was one of the best pizzas I've eaten in my life
My two friends also thoroughly enjoyed their food too with everyone complimenting how good it was.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is perfect, it's very homey and welcoming. I think it is a great all-around place that would be perfect for romantic dates and also for family meals and whatnot.

All in all, I know the next time I visit Glasgow, this will be one of my go-to places to eat"
"The staff was very rude. When I asked what the dessert of the day was I got told rather harshly ""no, no, no, no dessert of the day today"" however wasn't overly fussed by that. I had the pizza which was very tasty and a cocktail. When we got the bill we kindly asked for the service charge to be removed where the waiter was confrontational when asking if we wanted it removed, snatched the receipt off of the table and crumpled it up in their hands, before stroming off to get a new receipt. Was an enjoyable experience up until that point."
Lovely restaurant in the centre of Glasgow. The staff were very attentive. We had a voucher from itison and it was brilliant. There were a good few things on the menu that could be made gluten free. Nice atmosphere and a lovely meal. Thank you!
Went here just after Christmas for some cocktails. Didn't have a booking but they still managed to find us a table. Really nice atmosphere and table service. Cocktails are really good with some classics and specials.
"Highly recommend, food was very nice and reasonable, cocktails were great, service was amazing, the decor and feel to the place really took you back to when it was the old booking office, very busy at the weekend so would book ahead. Reasonable prices"
"We popped in here while out a walk in town and it was absolutely stunning
Service is top class and as expected so was the drinks and oysters
Only wish we found it earlier on walk as we couldn't stay longer.
My first time trying oysters and loved them.
We will be back for cocktails and oysters very soon.
A great place in the heart of Glasgow"
The food and service were excellent. Def on my list of fave restaurants.
"At Tony Macaroni in downtown Glasgow, my experience was unfortunately far from satisfactory. I ordered mussels with garlic bread, largely because it seemed to be one of the few options that wasn't fried or akin to junk food. The presentation was disappointing: the mussels were crowded onto a small plate, with no side dish for the empty shells, rendering the meal mediocre at best.

On a slightly positive note, the dish was not overly salted, which I appreciated. However, the service left much to be desired. I requested hot water with lemon and was served cold water with a slice of lime instead. Overall, I can't say I'd recommend the experience."
"This was a lovely family dinner, meal & service were excellent but I think we'd booked on Teen night. There were numerous tables of kids likely aged 14-18 who were all very well behaved but as you'd expect, pretty noisy so it made it difficult for us to hear our own conversation at times. I'd maybe suggest cordoning off an area for these guys, I think it's great they have somewhere to go (and buy 2 starters between 8 üòÇ) but maybe creating a little divide would help everyone enjoy the space.

I do also have to mention that the toilets are dreadful and in serious need of a refurb, as is the carpet (which is sticky) in the stairwell to the toilets. But that can't be helped by the staff who were all fabulous."
"Food was enjoyable. Staff were very warm, friendly and helpful with choice of menu. Although we didn't get to eat any dessert because we were extremely full from having the starter platter and the main dish."
"If you're on a budget then this place is good enough.
We had pizza, carbonara pasta, calamari starter and white wine.
Wine was good, and the food wasn't too bad either.
Restaurant did seem not to be looked after, a little cluttered.
But otherwise okay experience."
We go here regularly for lunch and always have a great experience. All the food we've tried has been great and the staff are always really friendly and helpful.
"Lovely little Italian restaurant! Food was amazing and staff were very attentive and polite. Cocktails were good too. Would recommend the black ink spaghetti with the scallops,  absolutely delicious! Will definitely be back here next time I visit Glasgow!"
"Nice small authentic Italian, decent food. Pleasant service, happily recommend."
"Absolutely amazing, the prices are amazing considering the quality, the service, the atmosphere. It‚Äôs everything you could ever want from Glasgow, homely, friendly, kid friendly with lovely staff with amazing food! Making an effort to every week now. Thank you!"
"Just a walk in and was happily shown to our table. Staff front of house attentive, good options of menu,we had a lunch time special. Minestrone soup,and bruschetta starter, followed by lasagna,  and a chicken mushroom, veg and rustic chips."
"We were here for dinner on 30/01/2024.  Fabulous food in a lovely restaurant and the staff were polite and helpful.  I have unusual allergies but, there were no problems and I wasn't made to feel like I was a nuisance.  Definitely highly recommend this restaurant"
"There is something about this restaurant that feels very authentic Italian from looking outside to the minute you step in. It's refreshing. The decor is traditional and modern at the same time and the atmosphere is great. We all thoroughly enjoyed our food which was delicious and fairly priced. Our servers were all very friendly and fast, my only criticism was that sometimes it was difficult to get their attention as it was busy when we went. Otherwise though I would recommend this place"
"Dreamy romantic place with hues of blue, yellow and white tiles for that Tuscany feels! Great courteous staff:)

Pros: Reasonably priced. Decent taste. Bruschetta had an onion puree which I thought was a unique touch. Loved the Oreo Cheescake and Brownie with ice cream!

Cons: Limited vegetarian options. Not much scope for customization"
"Food was excellent & service was outstanding without being too intrusive. My OH's prawns tasted like they had come straight out of the ocean. 2 mains,2 drinks,coffees & a starter for ¬£65 these days is a bargain."
"Amazing restaurant!! Gorgeous cosy vibes & the staff were so friendly, in particular our Italian waiter a young gentleman who was so so attentive and kind. Food was delicious and they had a live singer who was just fabulous! To top it off the food was absolutely delicious, highly recommend!"
"A modern gourmet kebab house right in the heart of Glasgow City Centre.
Friendly staff served the most delicious Greek/Turkish food, cooked to perfection. We had the special offer lunch menu for around  ¬£13 - choice of mains, fries and soft drink - great value.
We will definitely return!"
"It was just walking distance from the hotel where we were staying in Glasgow, not only that but it also had a good review on Google. There was a pleasant atmosphere, and there was no problem ordering food by looking at the menu. But after we ordered, we just asked them if they had any special items, and then they recommended the Lamp Escander, it was the best dish of what we ordered. As I had to leave in the morning, I postponed my desire to go for another time."
"Absolutely lovely restaurant, fully booked but made an effort to accommodate and got us a reservation to return in an hour (unlike multiple other restaurants that just turned us away)

Food was incredible, (having lived in Greece, it lived up to the standard!) staff were lovely, attentive and we also enjoyed some great, reasonably priced cocktails too!

We both enjoyed a chicken and halloumi souvlaki as well as a side of Ravasaki (Fried Feta in honey) then shared a delicious chocolate tort. So 2 cocktails, one starter, 2 mains a side and a pudding (and a tip) all came to ¬£61.50 which we thought was very reasonable.

Highly recommend"
"The food quality was great. It came in quickly but the portion was relatively small especially the burger.

Friendly staff and beautiful setting."
They were nice enough to let us have a table that was reserved in an hour from the time we arrived. I liked my gyros. My friend likes his lamb (cooked perfectly as he asked).
Visited here on Valentines Day. I was well served. The taste of the dishes were very authentic and excellent. I would definitely recommend this place if you wanted to try real south Indian style food
"Food was authentic Indian. Dosa and chutney made me feel I am right in India.
Lemon rice, curd rice, were to the point. Enough quantity for the cost you pay. Brilliant taste. Like India. Service is good.

Pepper chicken, chicken biryani were average . Parking is difficult."
"Our first visit here for lunch. Nice decor and friendly service.

We ordered lamb bhuna, prawn madras, pratha, dosa and tri rice and pot of tea and glass of luke warm water.  I wanted my prawns cook with coconut milk instead of tomato based.  The chef came to our table to find out how I would like my prawns madras spicy or mild?  I said medium spicy. He said he will make it special for me. It was good. My friend loves her lamb bhuna.

The owner and the chef are very friendly. The owner came to our table and had a wee chat with us. He asked us how was the food? And the chef asked how was my prawns madras? Well, as you can see from the pictures below.  We demolished it.  We will come back again."
One of the best South Indian restaurant in UK. Food was extremely tasty that worth the price. Staffs were polite and attentive. Thank you for such great service.
"Food is strictly okay. Staff is friendly. We had quite a variety of dishes here and weren't particularly delighted with the flavours. That said, we did enjoy the Indian filter coffee and would recommend that if you're a coffee lover."
"Booked the private room for a smallish wedding 40+ guests.

Nuncio, Anna, and every single one of the staff made it so easy for us. They could not do enough. Real old style Italian hospitality. The food as usual was excellent. Always 5 stars.

I would recommend this Mediterraneo in a heartbeat for everything from a simple romantic meal to a small conference in the private area.

Thank you everyone for making a special occasion very special. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Popped in by chance and would be back. 100% recommend, service was quick and all of the staff were wonderful. Food was excellent and very reasonably priced. Surprised by size of side dish as shown in photo."
"Very nice place. The food was quite good. I had the beef tagliatelle and the burrata with tomato starter. The starter was fresh and lovely. Mains was good too. And service was also quite good. All in all, happy with the whole package."
I ate here with a bunch of friends for my partners friends' 40th. Food was delicious and our waiter was lovely. Me & my partner shared the chateaubriand it was 10/10.
"Food was good, they have a lunch menu too."
"The food was awesome as we ate there for 5 nights in a row. The Soup of the day, Haggis croquettes, Sunday roast, Braised beef, Chicken schnitzel, Beer battered haddock, LBA beef burger and their warm sticky toffee pudding was to die for. The negative about this place is that if you get there around 8pm then the staff tell you that they are expecting a large party and then try to deter you from eating there or tell you point blank that they cannot accommodate you even though the restaurant is mostly empty. We were staying at their hotel, so they had no choice but to give us a table, but this occurred every night with different staff. And every night, we noticed that their large party never materialized so I assume they do it on purpose so that they can clean up and go home early rather than have to deal with customer past 8pm."
Fantastic quality food and a must try. The mushrooms are absolutely incredible as a side to your steak. My steak was cooked medium and was exactly how I asked it to be cooked. The atmosphere was also fantastic and a high-end feel to the place. Would certainly recommend to anyone who wanted a nice romantic meal out!
"Went for a weekend lunch for two. Service was amazing, the menu was well explained and our server was helpful, attentive and super friendly. The food was great, the sea bass tartare was my favourite and the steak was cooked perfectly and I recommend the roast vegetables side to go with.
The best part has to be the decor and interior, impeccable attention to detail makes the experience feel luxury even in the middle of a cold rainy Sunday."
"Visited on Sunday and had the sliced sirloin roast, I was really impressed! The meat was so tender and tasty üëåüèª beautiful presentation and the veg was delicious too. Service was also friendly and quick would definitely recommend."
"I went to Browns with my Partner for Christmas Eve dinner (which is kind important for us because of the culture factor) and we took Festive üéÑ 3 courses menu üçΩÔ∏è with drinks üçπ

First we place the order for drinks and we went with Negroni (which was sadly out of stock) so as alternative replacement was recommendation (from very professional and super kind 'Romanian' waiter) to try Old Fashioned cocktail instead. Which was not really close to Negroni but for Scottish Whiskey Experience fine enough üòä
Cask - Belheaven - local beer was really good üëç

For Starter I took Smoked Salmon (again Scottish üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åøü´∂) with Horseradish Cr√®me Fraiche, capers and toasted ciabatta. Which was a fair introduction to the Main dish.

Braised blade of beef üçñwith mashed, quite sophisticated selection of veg and black garlic sauce was very tasty and meat was incredibly tender

And for the dessert I get classical Christmas Pudding üçÆwith Brandy butter which was alright but a bit to dry.

Of some reason we didn't get our Finish what supposed to be Cheese üßÄ Selection ü§∑

Generally quite pleasant dinner we had but we both agree that portions have been a bit to small and there wasn't much to be surprised of the textures or ingredients.
For ¬£38 without a drink it was still one of the cheapest Festive Menus option in central Glasgow but we guess it was a slightly disappointing.
In TOTAL we have paid almost ¬£125 and that's a lot in our opinion.

No matter what it was pretty nice evening after all (with a bit of thrill üí£ when we received by mistake not our bill for ¬£260üòÖ)
So we had a joyful time."
"1 main returned twice - items cold
1 main returned - main element cool
1 dessert tasted like a stale donut and luke warm
1 christmas pudding cold and tasted like it was uncooked from refridgerator.

Staff dealt very professionally, removed automatic charged 10% gratuity, which is a poor practice for a table of 3, and we were not charged for desserts."
"the geezer serving us was a gent, we were hungover to bits but this place looked after us, lobster ü¶û Benedict and traditional breakfast were top class, mouth watering food to finish it ff a lovely trip to G-town, Rise up Glasgow, can‚Äôt wait to return! So reasonably priced too, Happy new year to the staff!"
The food was delish! Our group had several of the dishes and all were good. Only item to improve was the pastry on the veggie Wellington was a little over-done.
"The food was good and arrived in good time .
The service was lacking a little. Our server seemed annoyed to be there.
The atmosphere was non-existent, but it's an odd location, so not much they can do about that.
Not the most comfortable seats.
We know zizzi food will be consistent, and for a quick after work bite, it was fine"
"Had dinner here last evening on the way to the cinema.
My wife had a lovely pizza I ordered Spaghetti Bolognaise.
I have eaten Spaghetti Bolognaise many a time and never had a problem.
Zizzi say on their menu ‚Äú our take on a crowd favourite, with a beef & tomato Ragu‚Äù
The Bolognaise description on Google. ‚ÄúSpaghetti tossed in a sauce made from tomatoes, minced beef, garlic, wine, herbs, and spices‚Äù.
Look at the first photo and see what I ended up with. A bowl of SPAGHETTI coated in olive oil. No taste of garlic, tomato and hardly any BEEF.
All for the pricely sum of ¬£13.75.
Very poor.
I‚Äôve added a couple of other photos of what I would expect when I order a Spag Bol.
Hint, hint Zizzi."
"Popped in for a bite to eat , staff were friendly and helpful.  Issue with ice machine , but nothing major. Also given wrong bill but that‚Äôs an easy mistake.  Food was fantastic."
Fantastic wee birthday dinner for my partner.  Staff where helpful and friendly and yes here I go üöª toilets clean and fresh
"At Zizzi, the food was delicious and the price was reasonable. Sweet potato fries were okay. Margarita pizza was good. The risotto was a bit salty."
"Me & my wife don‚Äôt get out much for dinner so when we do it‚Äôs so important to us that we select the right place.

Honestly this may have been one the the single greatest meals I‚Äôve had in my life time.

Apon arriving I felt the restaurant was small and was slightly concerned with the table size.

The staff made the experience feel intimate without being intimidating.

The food, WOW. I opted for the scotch egg and sirloin and my wife went for the soup (parsnip and lemon) & filet.

Both of us after each bite shared a look of joy and can honestly say this was the greatest steak I have had in a long time.

After a toilet break I was smiling from ear to ear because instead of the usual elevator music the toilets had a tape of Scottish comedian Kevin bridges playing, I felt this was a very nice touch as not only did it make the toilet break a fun time but it was a nod to Glaswegian culture in a restaurant that initially felt it was taking its self to seriously this help to set the atmosphere as a place that takes the food and customer experience seriously but maybe not its self.

My only feed back was the lack of a cocktail menu on the drinks sections, I would have loved to have washed this down with a negroni, I‚Äôm sure if I asked they would have helped but without a clear cocktail menu I was apprehensive

We will be back."
"Lovely little restaurant, perfect ambiance, delicious wine and food. I started off with the tomato & carrot soup which was delicious and for the main dish I had the Sirloin steak. Really enjoyed the gravy that came with it. If I ever make it back to Glasgow I will dine here again!!"
"We received a gift voucher for here and were so excited to try it based on the reviews.

Unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed. Both of our steaks were so bland; it was unbelievable. There were some parts which were and therefore those parts couldn‚Äôt be eaten. The peppercorn sauce was watery and the mushrooms were inedible.

The chips were nice but when you are spending this kind of money on a steak, there is a standard that should be met.

We have been to many steak places and therefore we had high hopes for here.

I was so disappointed by the dinner that I didn‚Äôt order a dessert because I didn‚Äôt want to spend any more money. We promptly asked for the bill after the mains.

It‚Äôs such a shame because the service was good.
The 10% service charge is automatically added here which is something that wasn‚Äôt mentioned to us.

Some people were very casually dressed which we didn‚Äôt like either.

We wouldn‚Äôt recommend this restaurant and have shared this with all of our friends and family. There are plenty of other alternatives which won‚Äôt leave you disappointed."
Such a lovely steak house! Food was amazing and service was above and beyond. Would highly recommend!!
"Read the good reviews and booked.

Good welcome and service.

Decided to skip starters and we knew the meat portions are large.

Amazing cote de boeuf. Really was a massive piece with a big bone with amazing chips and small salad with one mushroom ( reminded me of an English breakfast) .

Meat was amazingly done. Medium rare.

Negroni was good just felt overpriced for Glasgow."
"I loved the sushi here, it is absolutely delicious!! Alongside the takoyaki & the Katsu curry. Generous portion sizes. A little bit lacking in atmosphere when you go inside, no music, and a bit cold. However, the food is great so you don‚Äôt mind it too much! It was empty, and it definitely shouldn‚Äôt be with the good quality of sushi on offer there!! I‚Äôll be back to try more on their menu üëèüèª"
"Great bento box option here!

The special bento box is such a great surprise, it came in such a huge portion with nigiri, maki, ebi tempura and chicken teriyaki!
The chicken teriyaki is soo good,  genuinely  surprised by that, it‚Äôs slightly crispy and I loved it!

The sushi were great and gyu don is my friend‚Äôs favourite, so if you like beef and onions go give it a try!

Plenty of seating inside and a variety of things from the menu you can choose from. Great price for the portions. Great service from Kenny. Would recommend this place to Japanese food lovers!"
"Haven‚Äôt been here in years and had a spur of inspiration to return recently as we were attending the theatre nearby. The food was absolutely gorgeous, I can‚Äôt recommend it enough. We had a starter and a main each and we left very happy, will definitely be back!"
"Easily the best Japanese food in the city center, and value for money.

They provide gigantic portions which I struggled to finish, and the food tastes excellent üëå

Reminded me a lot when I was back in Japan. Atmosphere was nice and quiet, they deserve more customers but they're far out.

Highly recommend you trek out to visit this place!"
Best sushi in Glasgow. Prices are excellent and staff are wonderful and very accommodating and welcoming. Can't recommend the food enough. Our daughter doesn't usually eat sushi but loves the food here. Best in Scotland by far!
"Nice Saturday afternoon for lunch and catch up with family. I would advise booking as was very busy. Great extensive menu, lovely atmosphere inside, our waitress was lovely, friendly and efficient. Now to the food :) I had the stuffed pepper that was lovely although I felt could have been cooked that wee bit longer. The pasta was ok, although over cooked. I would go back and try something different.  Reasonable priced and coffee (flat white) was OK if a little strong"
Really special night. We booked in advance for a table for 19 to feed our wedding guest. We just wanted a nice relaxing meal after a small cosy wedding. This place was perfect we have eaten here before and the food was fab! They served up a set menu which had something for everyone (menu 2) I think it was very reasonably priced and a perfect way to end our celebrations. The server were excellent my guest were never without a drink and there was nice spaces between course. Really great day to end our day so glad we picked this place.
"I really liked this place. The servers were great and one of them was very funny, which is always nice. The pasta was very tasty. However, the pasta was a bit overcooked, which was a bit disappointing.

My pizza was the star of the show, though. It was easily one the best and most tasty pizzas I've had in Glasgow. Using that oven definitely makes a difference. The bottom was crispy without being burnt, and the toppings were generously added on.

The waiter didn't use a notepad and forgot one of the items from the order. It's all fine and well if you can remember everything, but if not, it's not best to just jot it down.

The decor and overall atmosphere of The Italian Kitchen was top tier. Overall, this place would be ideal for a date or family meal. Highly recommend."
"Good place for a relaxing meal, which tastes good and served timely.
The staff are nice , though if the place is busy they can be a bit distracted and disregard signs from customers clear as daylight.
The pizza is ok, ours was fine but we had a bit of flex in the pasta base. I would not go for specifically for the pizza here and they have no other base than tomato base.
Many places near by has other base at least a few.
The chips is great and the pumpkin soup was delicious. The squid could be better, as a starter that was a bit rough.
Coke was a bit strange, not sure which type was it. Otherwise clean and tidy place but a bit crammed and no option to have a pram at your table which makes a bit complicated for families with little one."
Delicious Italian food for a good price. The gamberoni pasta was delicious and we liked the service too. Perfect for a nice occasion
"The large amount of people eating here are people who are about to go to the theatre next door. We discovered this as when we arrived the place was packed and within 30 minutes it was just us and another table left as the show was starting and everyone left. Good to keep in mind that the busyness  of this restaurant is tightly coupled to the theatre shows. The food is great, as is the service and the prices are decent - all certainly above the other Italian chains in the area. Overall a good experience and we'll be back."
"I'll be honest I was disappointed. The prawn cocktail was not very fresh. The prawns were very hard and the salad was limp, the sauce was watery. My main was better, the sauce was nice but then the chicken was rubbery. The salad again wasn't too fresh - but I was hungry and had nothing much to eat that day. My daughter had a better meal, her mozzarella sticks were tasty and the pizza was nice. The staff were lovely though. I did feel it was a bit expensive for what we got, but then it's the city centre."
1st visit this evening for dinner 10/2/24. Food was delicious and great service. The restaurant was buzzing. As a disabled customer (who generally doesn't  like busy places) I felt really welcome and safe. Good selections of cocktails too.  Thankyou we will be back soon. Would recommend :)
"Simpliy delicious food. I was not a fan of Italian food back in Canada, regardless of high-end or casual restaurant. Then I realized I simply hadn't had the real Italian food until now. Their cappuccino also redefined my understanding of coffee, the foam floats on top and doesn't shrink at all. The balance between milk and expresso is perfect"
"Very friendly and very fast service with fantastic tasting food. Great inside, everything was clean and well maintained. Nothing to fault.

Had 2 pizzas, both came quickly and hot. Crispy bases so you need to eat them fast.

Staff were very friendly and attentive.

Can‚Äôt say enough about what a nice restaurant it was. Will definitely go again when I am in the area."
"Lovely space. Had to wait awhile for anyone to acknowledge us when we walked into the hotel. The drinks menu could have more on it. Still would come back again ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Update: Went back for a dinner and it was lovely. Very nice waiter and the food was amazing."
"Really cute and cozy caf√©/bar/restaurant with great atmosphere! The staff was really nice too, we arrived late and they kept our table. Food was great, with also GF options. Only note is the price of dessert ¬£9 for the brownies which were good but a bit overpriced I think."
"Absolutely wonderful! From the food to the service, everything was incredible. I highly recommend the french toast, the portion size justifies the price. The service was attentive and polite (without being overbearing), and the food came out relatively quickly. They also have a range of mocktails which are delicious.

My only criticism would be that the mocktails are expensive considering there's no alcohol and the door doesn't fully close so it can get chilly if you're sat close to it."
"We love this wee place~~ the best crepes we‚Äôve ever had in Scotland! And the melting baked Camembert was so attempting!

Heart warming services and excellent food! Definitely will visit again."
We travelled from Edinburgh to Glasgow to celebrate üçæ Valentine's day ‚ù§Ô∏è . My husband did it as a surprise.  Wee Paree never fail us with their food and service.  We miss the sharing meals though.  It's not on offer at the moment.  But their French food menu tops all the time.  Well the patrons speaks for itself all the time.  Resto is always packed.
"A lovely atmospheric little local restaurant - excellent spot for brunch and good coffee, and great kind and thoughtful staff. While they don't have a specific kids menu they kindly made up a child's portion on request, resulting in the cutest serving of mini pancakes, bacon and maple syrup I've ever seen!"
"Service was poor. Upon arrival and during our visit, the staff were not welcoming. My wife spoke to a member of staff when we arrived. The staff member walked away when my wife was still talking to ask her question. so rude!

However we've heard great things about the food. The kitchen clearly doing a great job as the food was excellent.
we had the Taquitos and Luch Libre chicken burrito.

we also had a mountain of Tortilla chips with not enough guacamole.

cocktails very over priced."
We went in for food with my friend and the food was absolutely delicious. The prices were reasonably good and drinks were so nice. The place was also stunningly. Definitely will visit again soon.
"This was an itison deal. The frozen margaritas were delicious in particular the lime. The guacamole was decent but there wasn't enough of it for all the nachos. The loaded fries were cracking. Loved them! The birria had a great flavour but the meat was a bit chewy. The carne asada was as I expected, good flavour & texture. Tacos did fall apart somewhat as others have said. Staff were a bit hit & miss. Didn't offer the ice cream which was supposed to be included as a dessert option. The churros were unfortunately a disaster, very oily & greasy which is not how they are supposed to be. With a few tweaks this place could be great though. It definitely got the right sort of colourful Mexican vibe. It was Friday, the 18th of August from just before 5pm."
"Absolutely 10/10. Service, atmosphere and taste. Number one Mexican in Glasgow"
"A great wee dinner stop, with friendly service. Have the home made guacamole and tortilla chips whilst you're waiting for your meal to arrive.
Our mains were a decent size, full of great ingredients. I'd recommend using all the sauces to add some 'ooomph'. The frozen Margherita was lush, and whilst the beers are small (schooner size), water is provided at the table.
I'll be back to try the loaded fries. They looked too big as a side for one, but enough for two to share."
"Really tasty Middle Eastern food, exactly what Glasgow has been missing. So tasty and portion sizes are very fair. Price wise it‚Äôs reasonable and the service was attentive and friendly. Ideal for vegetarians too."
"Great place for Lebanese food. Lovely ambiance to sit in.

Came for a late lunch with a large party. Service was excellent and food is mostly good. Some of the flavours are a bit strange for Lebanese food and don't go together but overall everything was good.

Service was excellent and staff were courteous, polite and rapid.

Accommodated a pram with no fuss. Only issue is there are a few large steps leading up so you may need a hand to get a pram/ push chair up and in.

Food is halal and there is also a good selection mocktails. Not that much veggie options tbh.

As always I will give it a second try and then see if it is any difference."
"Was really looking forward to coming here as the reviews were amazing so we finally booked for our anniversary‚Ä¶

I‚Äôll start by giving the benefit of the doubt that we came just on a bad night but we were basically ignored from the moment we got in the door. We were sat in the corner and it took 20 minutes to take our drinks/food order.

Our food came before our drinks even though we only ordered a beer and a wine, the food was okay but VERY PRICEY.

The prawns, lamb and dipping platter were really nice but the octopus omg.
¬£16 for what is shown in the picture was a literal joke, we actually showed our friends & family the next day how pathetic it was because it was laughable.

We waited so long for the potato‚Äôs to come that we didn‚Äôt even want them anymore but the sauce tasted sour for some reason? We didn‚Äôt complain mainly because getting someone‚Äôs attention was near impossible‚Ä¶

Staff were VERY friendly but a staff member was upset in the bathroom to which I hope she was okay!

Might visit again for drinks or something but not in the near future. Like I said, maybe we just came in on a bad night!"
"Stylish restaurant serving great food a short distance from the city centre. Really enjoyed  the tapas options, the only slight disappointment being the octopus leg. This dish was a bit small and over charred for the price. Staff are very friendly and attentative, food is served 'when ready', which was actually a bit too fast, but not an issue."
"Fabulous food, especially the prawns. Gorgeous wine, we had the Lebanese Chardonnay. Brilliant cocktails too. Perfect place for celebrating my birthday, and will be back many times before the next one."
Excellent food and wines. We had a wonderful evening with friends. My scallops and the chicken Kiev were very delicious and went well with a glass of ros√©. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Thank you! Would like to come back during the next trip to Glasgow.
Great food and service. Decor inside is lovely
"My partner and I decided to dine here for valentines day.we opted for the valentines set menu, which was reasonably priced at ¬£50 per head. The starter of the scallops was amazing!Steak was a tad underdone for what we asked (med rare), and we had to send it back. It came back out promptly, and we enjoyed the rest of our meal.

This place gives off Ivy vibes, very much the same in decor and dishes

8/10

Would definitely come back"
"Great drinks & NA cocktails, interesting new menu, and tiramisu was big but delicious (shared)."
Amazing food and friendly staff. Special thanks though to Tricia who made us feel most welcome. We will definitely be returning.
Came here for lunch yesterday as part of research for college beautiful modern restaurant excellent service from Sam who was very cheery and helpful had haggis trio amazing and the pork belly was delightful sirloin and burger for mains plenty on the plate food terrific plenty on the plate and struggled to finish would defo recommend and will be back thanks guys üëç
"We enjoyed an excellent Sunday roast in the lovely restaurant in Bath street Glasgow- the team are really nice, there is no rush and not only is the food really good it‚Äôs presented very well- next time in Glasgow we plan to return during the week for a Steak!"
"A small, cosy central place located in the city centre of Glasgow on Bath street. The decor provided a homely feel, with a Scottish touch and the staff all went above and beyond.

Starters: 
Haggis trio: 7.5
Bruschetta: 7.4

Mains overall: 9.3
Sharing chataurbriand steak with sides of
Macaroni cheese and Chicken and Parmesan fries

Cocktails were outstanding too!"
"Was absolutely lovely visiting here on our holiday, Sam was so polite! The wine was lovely and the steak wow! Best I‚Äôve had"
Absolutely fabulous meal! Do it! The lobster was big and buttery delicious. It was a wonderful experience! 
"Its not cheap to eat here but you will not leave hungry!  It is well worth it! You pay for your lobster at the entrance so decide how hungry you are before you sit down!  I chose a 1 pounder and my husband chose 1 1/2 pounds. It was totally enough.  You are offered seconds on everything except for the lobster. Started with bread and butter. Choice of soup or chowder.  I had the soup of the day which was excellent and my husband chose the chowder which he loved.  Then buckets of mussels.  Next course was 3 different salads - small portions but totally adequate.  The lobster is all cut up for you for ease of eating. They supply bibs and all the tools for getting all the meat out.  The desserts were delicious. I chose the mile high lemon meringue pie and my husband took the coconut cream.  Yummy.  Tea, coffee and soft drinks included.  It was so crowded as lots of bus tours come in but it was fun and there's tons of room for everyone.  The service was excellent and was super friendly.  Would highly recommend eating here."
"This is a must go spot in PEI.  Make the drive and enjoy the experience.  Bring a serious appetite and they will squash it like a bug.  This is a new favorite spot for us when visiting the island.  When asked for seconds, just say ""yes"" and get after it! Enjoy!"
"We have always thoroughly enjoyed our experience here when visiting PEI. It is efficient, pleasant and clean, and with warm and friendly service. It is very reasonably priced. A must!"
"We have had a  very full and sumptuous dinner at the New Glasgow Lobster Suppers. Unlimited buckets of fresh mussels were provided as appetiser. I was half full after eating more than 10 mussels. The lobster meats was slightly tough probably from overlooking. However, I still enjoyed it. The Atlantic Salmon that my husband had was very tender and juicy üòãüëç!! I had to skip the desert."
"This is a must place to visit
Looks nothing from the road , but a warm welcome awaits...grab your drink and go to the terraces, and the roof terrace, you will not be disappointed ( will not ruin but the view sells this place) 
Sa hi to the parrots for me and put your feet up and chill Tobagan style"
"For anyone traveling to Tobago, this is a must stop on a sight seeking tour. Not only because of the amazing photos that one will take home, but it's the perfect place to sit, have a cold beer, and feel the stress leave you. "
What a view from this lovely rustic bar.  Friendly owner and the mUsic was great too.  Good stop off to enjoy a cold drink and take in the views.
"I saw Glasgow‚Äôs bar as I turned a winding corner en route from Castara to Charlotteville.  Needless to say, I made note of the bar straight away, for the return trip later on during my holiday.  The location of the bar was clearly worth a stop, and I‚Äôm glad we did.

Glasgow‚Äôs Bar is perched on the crest of a steep slope overlooking Parlatuvier Bay.  Mr Kurt Glasgow has the perfect establishment for an afternoon beverage on a humid Caribbean day.  The bar balcony overlooks the bay and captures the breeze coming off the ocean.  The concreted balcony has plenty of spots to relax with your drink, protected from any tropical storms!

I had a strong rum, my girlfriend had a carib beer.  Then we had another.  The staff were friendly and it was hard not to want to just stay all day and watch the tides come in and out.

Attached to the bar is a takeaway restaurant ‚ÄúParadise Point Finger Licking‚Äù and the name says it all.  We ordered stewed fish and dumplings, and ate our meals on the table next to the restaurant in the sun.  Whatever you chose to eat, ensure that you get dumplings!

Our drinks came to TTD$38 and our food was TTD$83.  If we didn‚Äôt have plans afterwards, we probably would have stayed for the afternoon, simply watching the world go by."
"We took a walk from Castara to Parlatuvier and here we stoped for a cold drink and to look over the view and down to the beach we were heading. Perfect for that, drink break with view! "
Another visit to our favourite restaurant. Menu has changed since our last visit but staff accommodated and let us order items no longer on the menu.‚Äôcan never fault the food or the staff always a pleasure and look forward to our next dinner there.
Wonderful experience. The food was excellent as was the service. If you like pate give it a try. Start to finish it was great!
"Visited the restaurant on Wednesday night with 3 friends.  The food was excellent and would highly recommend it.  Just after the coffees arrive one of our party became seriously unwell,  the staff were very quick to react and attentive and make sure an ambulance was called.  Stuart the front of house manage and his team very excellent and looked after us with care and compassion while we waited on the ambulance.  Outstanding food and service and definitely worth a visit."
My Husband and I had another amazing meal here tonight. Good and staff are first class. Just everything is perfect. Look forward to our next visit
Another visit to our favourite restaurant in Glasgow. A beautiful restaurant and of course the food is excellent üòã we might only visit once a year but we look forward to our fab meal üòä
"Been to Ka Pao a few times but not for at least 18 months maybe longer. We booked for the Glasgow restaurant week set menu with great anticipation and loved every dish. Everything was so full of labour, fresh and great portions. Delicious. Service was great. Tried a cocktail which also got top marks. Can't fault a thing. Will hopefully be back soon 10/10"
"I was in the area and searching on trip advisor this restaurant popped up. It happened to be Glasgow restaurant week and they had a special menu with 5 different plates plus dessert for 25 pounds so I chose it. 
I liked all the plates I had, except the salad, it had too much mint for my taste. The service was fast and efficient, the atmosphere very nice, big space and naturally lighted despite the fact that it's at a low floor.
I would return anytime"
"Need to book in advance to guarantee a table. The food amazing! So fresh and flavoursome, good value for money. I am not vegetarian but the vegetarian dishes steal the show, so creative."
"Really nice room, sultry lighting, open kitchen. Gorgeous corn, chicken and peppers, the portions were generous so they actually let us cancel our pork special as we were full! I asked if they could use it for the next order and it wasn‚Äôt a problem at all. Yum from start to finish!"
"Nice place, very different dinning experience, strange combination of foods some of which worked and some didn‚Äôt, decor was nice but a little dark, very busy."
"The delivery team were friendly. However, I ordered multiple items and one of them was not delivered. I was not emailed to make me aware of this. I paid ¬£25 for my items to be delivered today, and this was not carried out. It wasn‚Äôt delivered due to it being out of stock. This is not the delivery teams fault, it is ikeas. I am extremely disappointed and dissatisfied."
Really good value but the children‚Äôs macaroni cheese is too salty for my 3 year old.   It needs a lot less seasoning     The other meals were good with no complaints
Absolutely awful breakfast. Cold and congealed. Cold Grey sausages. Cold Bacon swimming in watery fat. Every item on the plate was horrible. To add insult to injury the coffee station was filthy and the beverages tepid. Milk dispenser was broken so had to use the slightly warm carton of milk which had been supplied. . Had same experience last time I used the restaurant..don‚Äôt know why I gave it another go but certainly won‚Äôt make the same mistake again. Really poor IKEA.
"The lady who sits on the till in the restaurant in the Glasgow IKEA who is called Jacqui needs to be removed from any customer facing duties as her attitude is appalling, her customer skill levels are shocking and she acts as if she is doing you a favour. She does not want to help anyone and when you ask her something she makes you feel as if you have no right to ask any questions and that you are annoying her . 

This has happened every time we visit when Jacqui is on the till."
"Despite advertising an assortment of breakfast items we were informed after waiting in the queue that there were none left.

When I say informed the colleague barked at us that there was none left.This is the kind of attitude I'd expect off a 5 year old and not the 40 odd year old serving us.

The woman at the til wasn't much better in attitude when we were trying to pay for drinks.

It's evident customer service in your caf√© in Glasgow isn't required to work here.Wont be rushing back."
"I am still in shock with the level of service, or should I say the lack of service

3.30 on a Monday afternoon, not busy at all there must have been 10 staff members on the floor but despite this the service was appaling 

15 min wait to order drinks, and then another 20 mins after finishing our meal before plates were cleared, I had to ask for the bill, even table opposite us were complaining as they hadn't been served and another 15 min had passed 

In a time when businesses are really struggling, you would think customer service would be a priority, but not in here not even as much as a thank you from the girl at the door as we were leaving 

I'm sorry to leave such a bad review, but that kind of service is just not acceptable "
Mehul was very attentive and observant. Brilliant service. Meals very tasty with generous portions for all 5 of us. Will be back.
My two girls and I had a great time at TGI's. It is their favourite restaurant. Chris was very attentive. Nothing was a bother. We will be back again soon. Thank you!
"Came in for lunch with my two sons, this is one of our favourite restaurants! Always guaranteed of great food and service, especially from Kyle M."
"Family Sunday dinner, and mixed feelings. The food was ok, but have to say the prices were too expensive for what we had. Simple starters of mozzarella sticks were nearly ¬£10 for 4 small sticks... Burgers really pricey
 Dessert was a let down. Did not have the first 2 choices, settled for a sundae, but once again at just under a tenner, too expensive. 
Service was a bit slow, and manager took part of the order due to allergies, and she was rather abrupt. Didn't fill us with confidence that our needs would be met.

Also when serving drinks, some was spilled on my burger, the waiter gave a quick flippant apology, I should have asked for a replacement burger as the bum was soaked.

Won't be rushing back."
"This is a fantastic place for a night out, attentive staff and incredible food! 

Waheed was our server, awesome guy 

Steaks are next level."
We chose this restaurant as it was close to hotel and we are couldn‚Äôt be happier with the fabulous service as soon as walked through the door and our lovely waiter Waheed who was very attentive and very friendly. Made a nice change to get such a lovely waiter who took time to speak. Then the food was first class the steak was cooked to perfection and the cocktails were amazing too. Thanks again Shannon & Clare üòä
An absolutely amazing meal made even more enjoyable by the fantastic service provided by Waheed. His attention was second to none and enhanced the experience. Can definitely recommend this as the place to eat
Food was very good and our waiter Waheed was very friendly and nothing was ever too much! Will defo be back thanks Waheed! :)
"Have been to the restaurant a trio of times and always a good experience. Waheed and Cassie are both excellent, super helpful and genuinely good at what they do. I hope they are being paid enough as they are the reason we come back!

Have had the Ultimate Roast which includes chicken, beef and lamb in the one dish, the Butcher‚Äôs Bangers Block is very tasty and the Rump Steak is pretty decent too. 

Would definitely recommend the restaurant for lunch or dinner, it‚Äôs never too busy even at the weekend and the booths are a nice place to dine."
"So we visit Glasgow regularly every 6 weeks from Liverpool, and we always try and find new places to eat when we visit. The curry cottage was this visit hit.
Sitting just one or 2 minutes from Sauchiehall Street, what I think may be Glasgows china town district, sat this little family run restaurant. Small menu, but all the choices you would need from Karahi to tikas to Naga.
We had chicken pepper pakoras and hagis pakoras which were dee lish followed by Keema Aloo which is lamb mince potatoes and spinach which is in an extremely tasty aromatic curry sauce and a Butter chicken which was so so tasty accompanied with Pilau rice and 2 Roti breads. The service was very personalised by the chef üë®‚Äçüç≥ and lovely lady. Great prices too, considering the quality of meals service and cleanliness of this little Glasgow gem.
All in all, I highly recommend a visit .
"
"Brilliant Indian restaurant. Authentic!
Superb tasty food (especially the lamb karahi dish).
I‚Äôve actually known the chef for a good number of years as he worked in another restaurant and at his period of working there it was a very popular place and my ‚Äògo to‚Äô for Indian food.
He now owns and cooks in The Curry Corner in Glasgow and I would wholeheartedly recommend anyone to pay it a visit. Moderate prices and very friendly and experienced staff.
What‚Äôs not to like!!!!
Enjoy."
What a brilliant little curry house. Freshly prepared poppadoms with great pickles. Two of the best lamb currys we have ever eaten. Friendly service and a very reasonable price.
"Our starters (chicken pepper fry & ginger fish pakora) and mains (lamb karahi, king prawn curry) were perhaps the best Indian dishes we‚Äôve had and we were looking forward to our dessert to finish off what had been an excellent meal. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. We both had gulab jamun with ice cream - one tiny doughnut tasting of nothing in particular with 2 scoops of bland ice cream - what a let down. Service was efficient and friendly, beer was ok but next time we won‚Äôt bother with the dessert"
"very nice, attentive staff and delicious food! the garlic & cheese naan was so good and one of the best curries ! üòã nice atmosphere, definitely will be back!"
"Great lunch & cocktails at Saint Jude‚Äôs, staff were so attentive and friendly from the moment we walked in. Will definitely be back."
Horrible experience. The gm Chris looked my whole family up and down and treated us like we were beneath him the whole time. Food was late and cold. My nans worst birthday ever and probably her last‚Ä¶.
"Absolutely appalling experience, food was cold, the drinks tasted watered down and the gm chris I think his name was, was rude and unprofessional at best! As soon as I arrived he gave me us a dirty look. Made me and my family's experience awful and totally regret going to the other well recommended venues in the area. 100% won't be back and can't believe that the management are in the position they are in. AVOID!"
Kids Kareoke package.  My daughter celebrated her 10th birthday in condo suite . Scott and the staff looked after us really well. The mocktails were amazing. Would recommend.
"At saint judes for a birthday. Great staff and great service. Louis and Glen especially went the extra mile to make the night enjoyable. Friendly, approachable and generally a good bloke. Thoroughly recommend and ask for Louis for some surreal chat."
"Really nice dinner. Lots of sharing of excellent food. Flavours galore. The staff was also amazing considering a good allergy -- showed us what was safe, as well as what could be made without. Super accommodating, and the meal was just terrific."
Great offer on Sundays. 3 tapas & dessert for ¬£22.95. It was delicious. Menu is separated into sections so vegetarian options are easily identified. We had 6 and out of a possible 12 (?). Amazing. All delicious. Special mention to the goats cheese! And the desserts were great too. We chose brownie and cheesecake. Staff were lovely.  Keeping an eye on everybody. It was very busy but the wait for food and a very nice glass of rose was minimal.
First time here and not the last. The host was great as we were half an hour early but got seated even though it was really busy. The service was top class with every member of staff working really well together. The food was excellent so will have to go back and try some different dishes. Really nice atmosphere though the chatting was a little loud at times which can't be helped. My recommendation is the gambas picantes.
"I loved this place so much, went there twice during my short stay in Glasgow.
The raspberry dessert I had was probably the best dessert I‚Äôve had in a while.
The next time I visited, I had their weekend Spanish Brunch, it was amazing.
Would highly recommend this place."
"Food is very good, we had a great selection of tapas and it was really tasty.
Service was quick, and the plates were really hot, which is a good trait.
It was a midweek day, and the place was still buzzing, so that was a good sign.
If you like Spanish food, I can recommend this place, and it's not extortionate in its pricing."
"Absolutely loved this place! Visited 3 times in 2 days. Staff were super lovely and the menu was fab.
I was the only vegan in our group of 3 and was impressed with the available options, it was hard to choose. Both breakfasts I had The All American pancakes, super fluffy pancakes with mixed berries, granola and maple.... So good!
Friends had french toast, granola bowl and smoothies and love it all.
Coffee was delicious and the added bonus of the music was good on all 3 visits.
Can't recommend this place enough.
I'll definitely go back next time I'm in Glasgow."
Delightful eating experience. Me and my daughter were in today. Lovely young woman said there was a ten minute wait but then found us a seat immediately. Delicious food at a very good price. Everyone smiling and welcoming. Highly recommended! (Keith and Amelia).
"It's the best place for the yummy food and also healthy food I would say.
The staff are very friendly. I love the ambience.
Definitely worth going to. I highly recommend this place if you are looking to have a balanced diet food."
"Amazing place to eat a breakfast!
We ordered Heatlhy Start and Flower Power smoothie. Very delicious and I did it feel hunger after eating at all.
Also the interior design is pretty cool!"
"Food was stunning as always. Big smile and hello when I walked. In Lucy was great, super friendly."
"Place is really cute. Doesn‚Äôt have parking which made it a little difficult to access as we had to find parking then walk there. But it‚Äôs a nice walk! The wait staff attention to detail could be better. Had to remind twice for water, I asked what a couple things on the menu were and they weren‚Äôt sure. I was given no cutlery when I got my meal which I had to ask for. The atmosphere was lovely. And the food ok. I made the wrong choice! The Dog menu is a cute touch!"
"Some of the best food nice have eaten for a long time.. Great staff.  Nice location, by the canal. Parking is tricky but we got a space. The crispy kale was amazing. Steak sandwich was outstanding.  And my hot smoked salmon, avocado on sour dough toast with poached eggs. Was also outstanding.  Free water to the table. Coffee was first class so was the pot of tea. Booking recommended."
Finally visited Ocho as it's been on my list to visit since moving to Glasgow years ago. It is a cute small place. Stunning views of Glasgow and a nice canal walk just at the front. Not the easiest place to get to but worth a visit
"THE WHOLE PACKAGE!
Ocho has it all for me - well presented tasty food at a reasonable price, genuinely lovely, engaging staff....and an incredibly scenic location.
I love it and recommend it."
"Food is good but the service and staff is excellent.

London Fog (earl grey with milk froth) was tasty.

Make sure it‚Äôs not a date if you‚Äôre going for the Turkish Eggs. Decent garlic!

Build your brunch is the best!

Definitely would go back for more."
"Omg - this was so good. The mango & peach pie is so much better than McD equivalents.
Chicken was nice and juicy. Spicy chicken was nice and properly spicy.
Only negatives was that 2 deliveroo drivers dropped but was still warm when arrived and they forgot/don't offer cutlery which would have been useful with the loaded fries."
"The Spicy Chicken Burger and Peach Mango pie was great, The chicken was tender.

However the loaded fries were a massive let down as was the gravy. The cheese was not melted (Likely because the fries were not hot enough)
The Gravy tastes like instant gravy you can find at a supermarket."
Nice junk food if you like to try one day but high price I think compared to other fast food. I hope they take care about cleaning after customers because it is disgusting.
"Came here too try chicken burger. It was good. & there chicken tenders were good too. Gravy was nice flavour. The chicken I got with burger on the side was too crunchy
And very dry. Would return for there burgers and chicken tenders
Returned 28th September. Dirty tables not cleaned for over 30mins while I ate my food"
"Excellent fast food chain in Glasgow city. The staff and Jollibee training programme definitely deserve credits here.

They were always smiling and well mannered, hardworking to clean up regularly. So the place looks tidy and welcoming with spacious seating.

Food quality is good with lots of choices. Fair value for money. Overall much much better than other fast food giants üëçüèøüëèüèø"
"Nice Saturday afternoon for lunch and catch up with family. I would advise booking as was very busy. Great extensive menu, lovely atmosphere inside, our waitress was lovely, friendly and efficient. Now to the food :) I had the stuffed pepper that was lovely although I felt could have been cooked that wee bit longer. The pasta was similar nice although felt it could also have been cooked a little bit longer. I would go back and try something different.  Reasonable priced and coffee (flat white) was OK if a little strong"
"Food was great, staff friendly and helpful. We didn't like where our table was sitting which was right next to the stairs leading to toilets. On a busy Saturday afternoon this meant there was a constant stream of people squeezing passed each other next to us while we were being served and eating, staff were also squeezing passed moving tables and chairs. Our table was not nearly big enough for our dishes. Enjoyable but not very relaxing."
"They offer a great tasting menu where you can order three small dishes. I ordered the pizza, spicy potato bites and garlic bread and it was all great, really nice flavours and good value for money. Will definitely be back to sample their other dishes."
"Went here just after Christmas. Booked online and was given a table upstairs.  The restaurant was really busy, we opted for the Christmas menu. I had the pate which arrived looking whipped, almost like chocolate frosting. There was so much, I didn't enjoy it.  For the main I really like the pasta Penne Mia Casa, was so nice. Its Penne pasta with chicken, broccoli and chilli. I had enough and didn't have dessert but still had to pay for all 3 courses.  My friend enjoyed her 3 courses, we had some cocktails they were not bad.  Would go back and think maybe when else busy would be have a better experience."
"Had a meal here on Friday night with my partner and had a great experience.

The decor is beautiful, inside and out, the whole place is very clean and well laid out and the staff were very attentive and friendly.

We had one of their sharing dishes plus a few sides (Carbonara, parmesan fries, garlic bread and 5"" pizza) and everything was delicious and extremely reasonably priced compared with other similar establishments in the area. We had a few cocktails as well and these were also very well made and delicious.

Perfect venue for date night or group celebrations.

Would definitely recommend and will certainly be back in the future"
"This was a gift from my daughter,it was Friday 29th Dec and the atmosphere was superb.We were seated upstairs and it was very cosy and exceptionally hot,Waiting Staff were quick to serve and friendly,cocktails  were delicious and the food was piping hot and plentiful the deserts were huge and rounded off our meal,it was very reasonably priced   10/10"
Service was excellent and the chef came out to enquire about our meals. Thd mussels as a starter were my highlight. Would definitely go back.
Lovely food and friendly service. Bargain lunch menu.
"We came in on the off chance of grabbing a table.  The man at the front of house said we could but he needed it back ASAP and we needed to be quick.  The service was then really slow, the starters were quick to come out but the mains took a good half hour at least to come out.

The food was okay but nothing to really shout about but it was decent value for many as we got 2 courses for ¬£20 on the pre theatre menu."
"Staff were nice, starters were good, the lasagne was watery, however, they have started adding a service charge, for a table of 10 I get it, but for a table of 2? Come on, I left the exact money and didn't tip. As I'll do with anywhere putting a service charge on."
"The food is really nice, but the waiter and owner of the restaurant were way too chatty, asking invasive personal questions, even though I clearly showed that I don't want to engage with them in a conversation and it happened to me several times already. Probably not visiting ever again."
