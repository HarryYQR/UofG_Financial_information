You could order the Afternoon Tea (which was NOT expensive for an afternoon tea; I was expecting to pay almost double before I saw the menu) or you could get regular breakfast food, like a really nice Eggs Benedict or French Toast. These were all delicious according to the group I was with! Would definitely recommend, especially if you'd like to bring someone for a nice Afternoon Tea and chat!"

Souffl√©, smoked salmon and chocolate bomb options were all ran out! I mean this is Xmas time if a restaurant at this level doesn't know  their market and demand after all these years then I'm not sure who should be! The food was lacking the wow factor when came out, we weren't particularly impressed with the look and taste which is very disappointing when you've set up such high bar for yourself!\nService wasn't great either you could see the staff are exhausted and not particularly thrilled to see you! the first servant wasn't so focused so accidentally dropped the knife on the table which could've easily ended in an incident; think he then preferred not to carry on with the service to us as poor guy was so embarrassed, and so passed us over to his colleague..\nWhen desert was served we noticed a soiled teaspoon which wasn't helping at all after all the experience we had already!\nAnd to complete the package when we were leaving and went to grab our umbrella at the entrance realised that it's gone! When asked a member of staff we were told it could've been lifted by someone! I mean are you serious?! At least don't offer customers to leave their umbrella at the door if you can't guarantee the security! Got really pissed by this as it was a sturdy brand new umbrella we got to use for the visit and now it's gone after a single use! Was raging and it ruined the whole experience even more so!\nSo no not a great experience this time round for us!\nAll the fancy stuff you see on the Instagram page is just for the sake of social media!\nAll that said, I do love the drinks and cocktails though and certainly do admire the interior design and ambience.."

We were off to a good start.\nWe had the 14oz Spiral Cut Angus Ribeye & Bar + Block House Salad with Salmon Fillet for our mains.\nWith a side of Onion Rings and a Baked Potato.\nThe Ribeye was absolutely fantastic, it melted in your mouth like butter, The triple cooked chips were really crispy and I loved them. The Chimichurri sauce was on point as well. The Onion rings were super crispy and melted in the mouth also. The salad and Salmon had the perfect balance of salad, dressing and avocado.

Definitely will come back!\n\nIt seemed like they have seasonal menu and change up the dish, so we didn't get the recommended beef caparccio. However, the rest of the menu piqued our interest.\n\nWe have:\n\n- Beef tartare (11/10): Presentation was ON POINT! The beef was sweet, umami, the egg yolk was light and airy, croutons added lots of crunchy character and made it so fun in the mouth to eat. The horseradish gave a fresh and refreshing taste. AMAZING!\n\n- Stone bass crudo (7/10): The fish was fresh, chewy, nice + paired well with the sauce. Definitely on the saltier side so we thought it would go well with some white wine. However, we don't like the hazelnut - it wasn't crunchy, the particularly hazelnut taste didn't blend well.\n\n- Spiced haddock (9/10): The spice was amazing + the SAUCE. We licked the dish clean.\n\n- Blood orange and fennel panzanella (9/10): The spice was amazing + the SAUCE. We licked the dish clean.\n\nEven at 4pm, the place still had 4-5 tables so definitely recommend reservations."

The recommendations from their excellent staff were amazing even though one recommended dish was out of my comfort zone it was perfectly balanced and tasted sublime - so thank you for making the recommendation.\nI doubt there is a better restaurant in the UK let alone Glasgow which compares with the experience and food at Ox & Finch - this is not hyperbole on my part, I have dined in everything from casual establishments to Michelin starred restaurants across the world and I, personally, think this is the best restaurant I've ever eaten in - I only wish I lived closer so I could do so more regularly.\nThe range of dishes allows for any and all palettes to be satisfied, we ordered a number of dishes (some pictured) and they all complemented each other; thanks to the recommendations.\nThe staff are very attentive without being overbearing and on this particular visit they went above and beyond which was very much unexpected but very much appreciated.  They engage when you wish to and leave you to enjoy in the perfect balance.\nI cannot recommend them highly enough, whether a local or on a visit to Glasgow make sure you book in for the perfect dining experience at Ox & Finch."

The dinner service was restricted to their set menu for Valentine's day and one could opt for a 2 course meal for 27.50 each or 3 course for 35 each.\nMy partner ordered a mains and a dessert sharing platter, and I went for a prawn starter and mains. The menu did not state that if you share the dessert platter it will cost extra and after we were reassured by the service staff that it wont be charged separately, when it came down to the billing time, there was an extra 7.5 quid added on top of our 27.50 each. There was also an added service charge, automatically added on top of that, both seems disingenuous to me. I don't mind paying service fee and having worked in the hospitality industry I will gladly hand tips to servers, but this was not acceptable. The extra charge for sharing dessert platter makes no sense, 'cos essentially my partner paid 35 quid for a bowl of pasta and 4 shot glasses worth of desserts.\nWe were told that the server did not know and she explained it to us incorrectly that it would be included in the price, and only after asking for clarification was one given to us. She also quickly went on to say that she would be happy to take off the service fee, as if doing us a favor while admitting to the fact that she gave us misinformation while taking the order. The whole situation left a bitter after taste, although the main course pasta was pretty good. The dessert platter portion wise was very disappointing especially considering the extra charge.\nFood was decent, I liked my risotto but the whole billing experience did not leave me with a positive impression of the place."

This restaurant has a unique set menu during lunch time, two courses is ¬£19.95, three courses is ¬£22.95. Because I don't want to eat dessert, I just order a Oven Baked Lamb Stovies for starters and a Ardnamurchan Estate Braised Wild Venison Stew for mains. The starters - Lamb with a piece of cheddar cheese stewed very soft, and it's delicious with its tangy tomato flavor and baked aroma. The mains - venison stew is rich in side dishes, and the mushrooms and potatoes have a unique taste when paired with the venison. The only downside was that the venison wasn't tender enough, but that was the problem with the venison and not with the restaurant processing it poorly.\n\nI also ordered an oyster, which cost ¬£3. If ordered 6 oysters, it would be ¬£15.  The oyster has a small size but absolutely fresh. Worth to try.\n\nOverall, this restaurant serves very good food.  If you come to Glasgow, please come and try this restaurant!"

The restaurant is small and usually fully booked, so getting a walk in is unlikely. The staff are attentive and polite without being overbearing. The Thai fusion menu was the theme when we went, the food portions are small, but it is a tasting menu, you are there for the experience, not to get stuffed full. I thought the food was delicious and creative with lots of different elements making up each dish. Being a bit of a fussy/limited eater I wanted to try foods I wouldn't normally eat, and the pumpkin spring roll gave me a whole new appreciation I didn't know was possible for pumpkin. I normally don't eat fish either, but the pan seared bass has completely changed my mind. If you want something a bit different to treat yourself, with a friendly and relaxed atmosphere, then definitely try this place."

The main, which was grouse - just a bit too hearty for me, and was seasoned with 5 spice, which was similar to the duck dish in 2021. The dish was very similar to what I had at the Balmoral earlier in the year... and I had the same issue with that as in, it just needs something to break up the richness of the protein. The dessert was milk and honey, was yummy, but just very similar to the 2021 flavours. The real star of the show for me was the mushroom dish with brioche ... was excellent. The service was spot on as to be expected.\n\nBest wishes. M"

We had the chicken burger with fries and spaghetti carbonara (the carbonara was quite creamy), with bruschetta classica. For dessert, cheesecake of the day (it was lemon, very soft and airy). We also had a banana split. Big thumbs up!\n\nThere were two nice members of staff alternatively waiting on people. The restaurant layout itself is very welcoming. The main part is probably the best area for people who may have any mobility problems. To the left and right of the bar, going up a few steps, you'll find seating. There is a very spacious disabled toilet located to the right of the bar area. It was spotless.\n\nAccessibility to the upstairs part of the restaurant and the ladies and gents toilets is via a spiral staircase. Again, the toilet facilities were gleaming.\n\nI think this restaurant may be dog friendly as well.\n\nContinuing on a canine theme, the S.O.T.B cocktails were the puppy's bow wows!!!!

Great extensive menu, lovely atmosphere inside, our waitress was lovely, friendly and efficient. Now to the food :) I had the stuffed pepper that was lovely although I felt could have been cooked that wee bit longer. The pasta was similar nice although felt it could also have been cooked a little bit longer. I would go back and try something different.  Reasonable priced and coffee (flat white) was OK if a little strong"

However, the pasta was a bit overcooked, which was a bit disappointing.\n\nMy pizza was the star of the show, though. It was easily one the best and most tasty pizzas I've had in Glasgow. Using that oven definitely makes a difference. The bottom was crispy without being burnt, and the toppings were generously added on.\n\nThe waiter didn't use a notepad and forgot one of the items from the order. It's all fine and well if you can remember everything, but if not, it's not best to just jot it down.\n\nThe decor and overall atmosphere of The Italian Kitchen was top tier. Overall, this place would be ideal for a date or family meal. Highly recommend."

I would not go for specifically for the pizza here and they have no other base than tomato base.\nMany places near by has other base at least a few.\nThe chips is great and the pumpkin soup was delicious. The squid could be better, as a starter that was a bit rough.\nCoke was a bit strange, not sure which type was it. Otherwise clean and tidy place but a bit crammed and no option to have a pram at your table which makes a bit complicated for families with little one."

They have the 2 or 3 course dinner menu which is absolutely smashing with great prices (less than ¬£19 for 2 course). We had the grilled asparagus and prawn cocktail salad, Turkey with cranberry sauce and Chicken with mushroom sauce.. To our surprise, we love every dish here. We had a wonderful dinner, the food served were all fresh, delicious and generous in portions. Servers are all prompt and attentive. The ambience here is warm, inviting and authentic.\nDefinitely will bring friends here."

I had bruschetta for a starter, and it was so fresh and bursting with tomato flavour. For my main I had a pizza and it was one of the best pizzas I've eaten in my life\nMy two friends also thoroughly enjoyed their food too with everyone complimenting how good it was.\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is perfect, it's very homey and welcoming. I think it is a great all-around place that would be perfect for romantic dates and also for family meals and whatnot.\n\nAll in all, I know the next time I visit Glasgow, this will be one of my go-to places to eat"

I had the pizza which was very tasty and a cocktail. When we got the bill we kindly asked for the service charge to be removed where the waiter was confrontational when asking if we wanted it removed, snatched the receipt off of the table and crumpled it up in their hands, before stroming off to get a new receipt. Was an enjoyable experience up until that point."

I ordered mussels with garlic bread, largely because it seemed to be one of the few options that wasn't fried or akin to junk food. The presentation was disappointing: the mussels were crowded onto a small plate, with no side dish for the empty shells, rendering the meal mediocre at best.\n\nOn a slightly positive note, the dish was not overly salted, which I appreciated. However, the service left much to be desired. I requested hot water with lemon and was served cold water with a slice of lime instead. Overall, I can't say I'd recommend the experience."

There were numerous tables of kids likely aged 14-18 who were all very well behaved but as you'd expect, pretty noisy so it made it difficult for us to hear our own conversation at times. I'd maybe suggest cordoning off an area for these guys, I think it's great they have somewhere to go (and buy 2 starters between 8 üòÇ) but maybe creating a little divide would help everyone enjoy the space.\n\nI do also have to mention that the toilets are dreadful and in serious need of a refurb, as is the carpet (which is sticky) in the stairwell to the toilets. But that can't be helped by the staff who were all fabulous."

Peppercorn sauce was quite creamy, more to my wife‚Äôs liking, I like a bit more peppery heat but it was still tasty.\n\nThe carrots side was excellent, you could really taste the difference between the different types of carrot.\n\nI thought the brownie was a bit dry and couldn‚Äôt really taste the maple or bacon flavours from the menu but it was decent enough.

The service was very friendly and quick as can be.\n\nThe food was nothing short of spectacular; probably the best steakhouse I'd ever eaten at. I'm a person who swears by a medium rare steak with bare minimum seasoning, but Porter & Rye's sauces took it to a different level. There are a variety of starters, or small plates, to choose from. Beef, pork belly, veggie, venison, pigeon; choose your choice of protein, they'll serve it to you in its tastiest form. We did not get to choose the cut of steak, as we went on the meat-up Wednesday deal, however there was absolutely no complaint on the steak. The sauces were mind-blowing; we ordered the Chimichurri, Macallan & peppercorn sauce, B√©arnaise sauce, and Bone marrow & black truffle butter. The most surprising part of this experience is that I did not expect the butter to be any special but I was proven wrong. I'm no wine expert, but whatever red wine we were served, we managed a full bottle of it. Lastly, my partner wanted to end the dinner with a Scottish Coffee; this was not as abhorrent as I thought it would be but it almost wiped me out.\n\nI will definitely revisit Porter & Rye in the future; they are a premium restaurant that serves premium quality food at a premium price (for a damn good reason). If you are a fan of steak nights, I highly recommend visiting on one of their special deal days to get the best value.\n\nThanks to Porter & Rye, I cannot buy Aldi steaks and cook them myself anymore as I know I'll just be disappointed in myself."

The dessert was good, maybe not great, but we were there for the main meal, and that exceeded what we were looking for."
