Number 16 Restaurant,5,"My husband and I were wowed by our experience at number 16. It was our last meal of our honeymoon, and we wanted a really good dinner. I cannot say enough about this restaurant. The food was exquisite. Everything from the soup to the entrees, to the incredible lemon dessert thing! The service was excellent too! I wish I could remember our servers name. He was super tall with reddish hair. 20 some thing.

I think one of the best references we can give is that we were sitting next to a party who were locals. Will locals as in three hours from the restaurant. They said that they never miss coming to the restaurant every time they‚Äôre in town. The next time we are in Glasgow, we will definitely make it back!"
Number 16 Restaurant,5,"A great find thanks to the Michelin Guide, where Number 16 very much deserves to be. Lovely little place with very friendly staff, really delicious food (the cured sea bass to start was absolutely exceptional). Really glad to have found this place: highly recommend."
Number 16 Restaurant,5,"We discovered this wonderful restaurant today. We ate duck leg terrine, cured salmon, venison ragu, pork belly & coconut parfait. Every dish was perfectly balanced and totally delicious. This small, but perfectly formed restaurant, is a must visit! Great service & lovely intimate atmosphere."
Number 16 Restaurant,3,"Yesterday I had a professional dinner at this restaurant with one of my colleagues and a guest we had from Netherlands. The food was ‚ÄúEXCEPTIONAL‚Äù. Wonderful tasty dishes! Honestly, one of the most tasty food I have tried at Glasgow. Unfortunately, the service that we enjoyed was below our expectations! The persons who work there were smiley and very friendly but three times made us feel uncomfortable. First, even though we went there early at 5.30 and the restaurant had no other customers besides us, one of the three main dishes they brought us was wrong. It was the order of our guest from Netherlands. The food was very tasty as mentioned before and we didn‚Äôt really complain about that. Second, when we ordered our deserts the waitress brought us the bill at the same time without having asked about the bill (maybe the waitress was thinking that we will not like to have an espresso). We also didn‚Äôt pay so much attention about that, mainly because we were so happy with the food. Finally, when we had almost finished our deserts and paid, and while we were discussing with our guest, the waitress without asking she brought us our jackets!!! This last one made all of us feel very weird. It was like ‚Äúyou ate, you paid, go out to continue your discussion‚Äù. Again to be honest, this broke our good feelings from the wonderful food we enjoyed. So, very good food, associated with not very professional behavior from the persons who work there. Sometimes the small details play very important role on the satisfaction level that a customer receives from a restaurant!"
Number 16 Restaurant,5,"Out for our anniversary dinner..
We both agreed that this was probably the best food we have had in the Glasgow area.

The food was exceptional and the service matched the food..
Great little restaurant with reasonably priced delicious food.. We will definitely be back.."
Ox and Finch,5,"One of the best restaurants in town, in fact I came down twice for lunch in between my conference talks over the past week. I would describe it as modern European cuisine in tapas style plates. Desserts (I had the semifreddo and that deconstructed affogato) are thoughtful and well executed."
Ox and Finch,5,"This review is long overdue. We went to Ox and Finch back in 2022, but I completely forgot to post a review. Fast forward to 2024 and my wife and I are still raving about our meal here. Excellent meal with great service. One of the best meals we've had in all of the UK."
Ox and Finch,5,"We went for dinner yesterday, the staff was amazing, the restaurant was cozy and nice, the food was amazing and our waitress lovely, she even prepared this little surprise even we had not asked for it. We recommend the sea trout and lamb! One of the best meals I‚Äôve had in the UK, so if you‚Äôre in Glasgow, book a table and enjoy."
Ox and Finch,4,"It‚Äôs overrated. Still, I would recommend it to a friend. We ordered duck salad, cod cheeks, rump fillet, lamb shoulder and warm ginger cake. Duck salad and rump fillet were tasty. Ginger cake was a bit too sweet for my taste. A hit and a miss I would say."
Ox and Finch,5,"We ordered 8 dishes in total (3 people) and everything was very well-seasoned and delicious! ü§§
Highly recommend the lamb shoulders, üêë buffalo mozzarella with kale, cod cheek and poached beam üêü
Rump steak was okay ü•© but we loved the sauce
Dessert looked beautiful and tasted surrealü•π
Service was quite quick and the staff were very friendly‚ò∫Ô∏è"
The Gannet,5,"On a 10 day trip to Glasgow recently this was by & far the best meal I had. I found it on my 1st cold ,rainy day in the SEC neighborhood while looking for a place for dinner before the World Championships madness started the following day. The 3 course meal was amazing & the host Kevin was lovely & welcoming. The bread was divine, the duck sublime, the pasta delicious & the dessert was the best part. Highly recommend & I look forward to being back on my next visit x"
The Gannet,4,"Visited back in December as a pre-xmas treat, had a lovely time and enjoyed all the food and the service was friendly and attentive.

There were some great individual bits on offer across the menu and everything was very enjoyable, but nothing that really blew my socks off. I'd happily eat here again, but as it's on the pricey side it maybe missed some of the magic I look for at this price point to make me want to rush back."
The Gannet,5,"An unbelievable experience! The food was utterly sublime, with every bite being a taste sensation. We took the 6 course tasting menu, as was an afternoon sitting, we didn‚Äôt choose the wine pairings. The cocktails were amazing, from a new twist on an old fashioned to the pink fizz!
The staff were great, they explained every course in detail and were very attentive throughout and we never felt rushed, even though we were there for over 3 hours.
Brilliant food in a lovely setting, we can‚Äôt wait to return!"
The Gannet,5,"Fantastic tasting menu and matching wine. Smashing service with dishes and wines being explained. All the dishes were great, tasty and leaving you wanting some more. Matching wines we very good, great selections from Eastern Europe, some you just would t expect. We also added a fantastic cheese course and took a vegetarian option, instead of the beef tartare‚Ä¶ service was excellent in this regard, nothing was a problem. Great night all round. We‚Äôll be back for more."
The Gannet,5,"Lovely food in a lovely setting.  We had an early lunch and it was beautiful quiet.  I'm sure with a few more guests the atmosphere would have been perfect.

The chicken and asparagus was fantastic and absolutely the highlight of the lunch."
Cail Bruich,5,Our dining experience exceeded all our expectations. We are not new to fine dining and Lorna‚Äôs creative cooking topped the list so far. Cosy private venue. Superb service. Phenomenal food. 3-hours felt like 3 minutes and at no point we felt rushed. Thank you very much Lorna and the team. Thoroughly enjoyed the unique dining experience that you all gave us with 100% attention to details.
Cail Bruich,5,"The ingredients were exceptional.

Beautifully presented in both plating and ability to allow flavour to shine.

Courses were correctly portioned to ensure a smooth tasting experience.

The casual ambience is matched by the relaxed front of house staff. They read us well and we enjoyed our conversations with them.

Highly recommended. It's obvious to see why the Michelin star hangs here."
Cail Bruich,5,"My recent dinner at Cail Bruich was truly exceptional. From the outstanding food and impeccable service to the delightful atmosphere, every aspect of the experience exceeded my expectations. Without a doubt, Cail Bruich deserves a second Michelin star for their outstanding culinary mastery."
Cail Bruich,5,Our first visit and very impressed....everything was FANTASTIC!!!! Siobhan was very attentive and good chat. Mr Sommelier was very knowledgeable and gave us some interesting tips! Flavours were amazing and some unusual combinations that worked so well. It was to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and it was incredibly special and the card on the table was a lovely touch. Thank you to everyone!!Jamie & Leza
Cail Bruich,5,"I was there for the tasting menu with my wife for her birthday and it was simply superb. Every part of the experience from the hard working and knowledgeable staff, who make each of the exquisite and beautifully prepared courses, made to perfection from the extremely hard working and expert chefs in the kitchen with Lorna, with the just the right amount of discrete theatre at the table to make them both exciting and memorable. The attention to detail and craft for each dish component is amazing and the Michelin star is well deserved. We absolutely loved it and will certainly return. Fantastic."
Ubiquitous Chip,5,"This was a fantastic restaurant for a nice night out. I went here with a friend and we both got scallops and venison, both of which were amazing. The service was also very good, as our server was attentive and informative. Overall I would definitely recommend going here at some point if you can."
Ubiquitous Chip,5,"My main is less inspiring ‚Äî ricotta and chestnut croquettes. The powder gives the sprouts a tempura-like crispness. The base of the squash puree is cold, though, and the rocket garnish miserably flaccid. The croquettes themselves are floury ‚Äî overwhelmingly so. One is pleasant; two is a chore."
Ubiquitous Chip,4,"Venison haggis lived up to its hype, the sauce is everything! Wonderful staff and beautiful space. The only regret I have from this experience is the mac and cheese, which was dry and tough. Maybe adding more cheese might help?"
Ubiquitous Chip,5,"I had an extremely delightful tasting menu experience. The staff were very knowledgeable about the wine and the food, and seemed as excited about it as I was. Some very clever presentations, as well. The ambiance feels lush without being stuffy or overbearing. I would absolutely bring anyone I know here."
Ubiquitous Chip,5,Amazing decor.  Great drinks and menu.  Loved having a vegetarian tasting menu.  Wish they advised we needed to specify if we wanted a tasting menu when making our reservation.  Glad they were able to accommodate.  Time in between courses was a bit long.  Looking forward to coming back.
Gloriosa,4,"I would recommend it to a friend. We ordered focaccia, artichoke, sea trout and squid. All were delicious except artichoke which tasted like the ones you had in a jar from a supermarket. The atmosphere was amazing in the restaurant with candles and all."
Gloriosa,5,"Visited recently for the first time and it‚Äôs one of those rare places that lives up to and even exceeds their reputation. Some of the best food I‚Äôve had in a long time, everything was delicious, atmosphere was good, and the staff friendly. Can‚Äôt wait to return."
Gloriosa,5,"Gloriosa is a culinary delight of simple goodness.  Honest , fresh and healthy food.  The focaccia is to die for.  I couldn't fault any dish in any way.  Presentation, taste and portions 100 percent satisfaction."
Gloriosa,5,"Great service, warm staffs and delicious food!
Good quality of food, you can see how detail the chef is.
It‚Äôs a bit expensive to me but it worths more than you paid for."
Gloriosa,4,"We have been many times to Gloriosa and always really enjoyed the food and general atmosphere. We have come with friends or just ourselves and like the mediterranean sharing plates. When we went most recently we got seated beside the front door which kept hitting us with wind and banging. The service was bad - while the small plates came fairly fast, we waited ages for the bigger plates (with no drinks as another wasn‚Äôt offered). We noticed that after the table next to us paid, the girl was waiting for her friend to use the bathroom to leave and she got told she had to move and couldn‚Äôt sit to wait, so she had to stand awkwardly between tables. The food was good but not as amazing as usual. The focaccia is amazing and I liked the eggs and panna cotta. But the clams were full of sand, the cavolo so salty it was inedible so that dish was way too expensive for what it was. The artichokes were ok but not incredible. I hope it was just a one-off but we were disappointed overall. We will definitely try again."
Bothy Glasgow,5,"Good food and great service only criticism is maybe the service charge being automatically applied to the bill however,the waitress was really good, very attentive and we didn't have an issue paying it on this occasion. Would definitely return"
Bothy Glasgow,5,"Ideal stop for lunch. Lovely setting and pleasant, welcoming staff. Every part of the meal was thoughtful and complimentary. Love the  pork belly with hazelnuts."
Bothy Glasgow,5,"My mum had her 60th birthday in the room upstairs.

Great night service was great. There are a few mistakes on the set menu, but it was all really good food and great staff.

Recommended."
Bothy Glasgow,4,"Went for a Sunday roast (beef) which was great. Service was good, walked in a busy Sunday night with no reservation and was seen to right away.

Atmosphere was lovely, food was delicious (sticky toffee pudding was unreal). Would recommend for a nice sit-down meal, spent 40 on roast dinner (surcharge for beef) with dessert and a pint which was fair for the quality of food"
Bothy Glasgow,5,"I went here for the Burns night with a friend and it was a spectacular evening, the atmosphere was wonderful, the staff were really good and attentive.

The food was great but not to the standard I would have expected for a higher end restaurant. I loved the haggis, neeps and tatties though the ham hock & lentil soup was just OK. The cranachan cheesecake was quite nice. My friend loved her salmon starter though felt the sticky toffee pudding was a bit heavy. She also thought the haggis was delicious.

The whisky flight was very good value for money considering the price of the bottles, I had the Isles one and would recommend it. We also had a few bottles of red wine, the cheaper ones tasted better than the more expensive bottle.

I'd definitely go back but would try other options on the menu along with another whisky flight üòÄ"
Stravaigin,4,"Stravaigin delivers a lovely dining experience. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, perfect for enjoying a taste of Scotland. I tried the lamb rump and haggis, and both were absolutely delicious! Definitely a spot I'd recommend if you're looking for a charming place with good food."
Stravaigin,3,"I went for the Sunday set meal, the haggis neeps tatties with pepper sauce starter were excellent. The roast beef with vegetables was not as good. The glazed carrot was just a small slice of carrot, the beef was quite rare. I was not given the choice of how I would like my beef. The roast potatoes were nice but few in number. The broccoli and cauliflower cheese were fine. We did wait a long time for the main to turn up."
Stravaigin,5,"Had a gift voucher to spend but definitely a place to go for excellent service and food as a treat. Sat upstairs which had low ceilings so if you are claustrophobic I would sit downstairs. Starters was the caramelised tofu to share and it was superb (forgot to ask what the sauce was) - recommend! Mains were rump steak and ox cheek, and chunky chips (crispy on the outside and fluffy inside). Steak was cooked to perfection, very tender and the sauce it came with went well with our side of chips; ox cheek fell apart, there wasn't any need for a knife, and the sauce was rich. Anyways, our server Cameron was attentive and friendly, the rest of the team - Marquis, Ilaeria and Sophie were on the ball! Hats off to the sous chef for doing well with the steak (sorry Head Chef looks like they raised the bar)."
Stravaigin,5,"After a brisk walk through Kelvin Park we arrived at Stravaigin, the Cellar. We were seated after my partner managed to smash a glass through careless control over her hand bag. We were presented with menus and I chose the Haggis Neaps and Tatties which came as three equal sized portions with sesame seeds. I followed this with steak, chips and pepper corn sauce. The waiter checked back on us a few times which was a nice touch. The desert was a small meringue with a sorbet and so apple shavings???
We had coffee, paid the bill and thanked the waiter.
This is a nice place to eat in a busy local venue."
Stravaigin,4,"Excellent place. Even though I didn't know you had to make a reservation, they seated us at the bar area and served great food. Selection was limited because they had a ""busy weekend"" and was out of steak and some other assorted menu items. I had the haggis to start and pork belly as a main. Superb!"
The Buttery,5,"First visit to this exceptional restaurant, wont be the last.
I would go so far as rating it my favourite restaurant.
Ambience - quality. Food - exquisite. Service - outstanding.
Thank you Ryan and your team."
The Buttery,5,"What a lovely dining experience! Food was fantastic, the bread with chilies was one of the best slices and a nice start to the meal. Cullen skink was great, too. Reasonable pricing and staff - from reservations to host to servers - were all exceptionally friendly, accommodating, and gave above par service. Very old school and traditional and would definitely return again."
The Buttery,4,"Good place, beautiful decoration, helpful staffs. Attended the wine dinner event last evening - the foods are all of good quality but not quite impressive. Although it‚Äôs an event of wine, I don‚Äôt really feel for the wine pairing. A good place if you wanna try traditional Scottish dishes!"
The Buttery,4,"Really tasty Scottish fare, the Highland venison was exquisite. Delicious desserts.
Fancy location, tastefully decorated.
Late evening reservation
Lost in our own world for much of the evening as we‚Äôd finally gotten to celebrate our Anniversary due to busy schedules
However, service noticeably rushed and mildly passive aggressive by the end, we were the last patrons. Marred the experience."
The Buttery,5,"An institution. 150 years old restaurant. Waiting staff, excellent. Menu, good choice , mostly seafood. Quality of presentation and flavour, high. Mother-in-law has been in the restaurant business for fifty years and is very fussy about her fish but absolutely loved her fish main course. Thought there was a little too much potato in the seafood chowder but flavour good. The decor and atmosphere comfortable not stuffy."
Porter & Rye,5,"First time I booked a table was March 2020 and we all know how that worked out üò• First actual time I had the pleasure of visiting Porter & Rye was in August 2021 and I have been a frequent guest ever since üòÇ (even my bank app thinks
I have subscribed to premium steak delivery). Anyway, after trying many different streak houses in Glasgow (which are all spectacular btw) nothing hits home quite like Porter & Rye. I used to live around the corner and it was my favourite restaurant of all time, now I stay 60 miles away and it‚Äôs unfortunately still my favourite restaurant üòÇ Book P&R today and join the fan club of Baked Alaska flavour changes and definitely order a cocktail/mocktail when you‚Äôre there (especially when Dan is there but they are superb all the time). Not sponsored and I still think the cow is creepy but it‚Äôs actually comforting now üòÇ"
Porter & Rye,5,My wife and I were there for the first time for our 21st wedding anniversary after lots of recommendations. I can say we were not disappointed. Everything from the quality of the food to the top notch service was excellent. Would highly recommend.
Porter & Rye,2,"Probably the worst steak I‚Äôve had in a really long time. Must‚Äôve been an off night based on the reviews, but I will not be returning. Service was decent. Mine was 2X maybe 3X sides were good but the steaks were horrible."
Porter & Rye,5,"We had a fantastic dinner at P&R this weekend - we arrived early but were well looked after until our table was ready - before our allotted time. The service was really excellent and food came at just the right pace. The food itself was very delicious , perfectly cooked and well presented. Definitely recommend."
Porter & Rye,5,"Excellent steaks and sunday roasts.
Good wine selection.
Staff are always friendly ,professional and knowledgeable.
Fantastic service
Nice atmosphere and good value"
Fanny Trollopes,5,"Great service, fantastic food. The rainbow trout with wipped goats cheese was unusual and outstanding. Deserts a great end to a really good meal."
Fanny Trollopes,5,"We had dinner at this lovely place. The waiter was very kind and charismatic, which absolutely contributed to the ambiance in the restaurant. The dishes were of good quality and were ""complex""; a lot of well chosen, special and tasty ingredients. The pricing is fair.
(The pigeon starter is very tasty, I forgot to make a picture)"
Fanny Trollopes,5,"Harry was very welcoming, patient with good knowledge of the food. The dishes were amazing, extremely tasty, delicious textures, and well thought out. We can't wait to come back."
Fanny Trollopes,5,Still ranks as one of my favourite restaurants in Glasgow. Top class food and service at affordable prices. A Glasgow must visit.
Fanny Trollopes,5,"The venue is small so I would recommend booking. The food is tremendous and the staff are so nice. What‚Äôs not to like. Will definitely being coming back for more. The desserts were delicious we had the chocolate fondu, sticky toffee pudding, apple crumble and oh so delicious custard and the cheeseboard. They were all fantastic and to be recommended."
Miller & Carter Glasgow,5,We had Zoltan as our server. He was so nice and polite. We tried a new sharing dish and he spoke us through all the ingredients. The meal was amazing. Great service
Miller & Carter Glasgow,5,"The Service was amazing, the food was quick to come out and the quality was unreal, we got the butchers block and it was more than enough for two, the cocktails were unreal.
The final bill was a lot of money, but I felt it was well spent on the quality and service, I would recommend this to anyone! Food heaven.

Thanks Mags!!"
Miller & Carter Glasgow,4,"While the food fell short of my expectations in terms of taste, I found it to be slightly overpriced. However, the waitress provided excellent service and was very sweet. The atmosphere of the restaurant itself was pleasant and inviting."
Miller & Carter Glasgow,5,"Michelle was an amazing server!! Very attentive and friendly, made some outstanding recommendations! The halloumi fries were a fantastic starter! The Ribeye was tender and flavorful! The sticky toffee pudding was a perfect dessert! Amazing restaurant, I will be back!"
Miller & Carter Glasgow,5,"Absolute quality, the food is phenomenal and service is second to none! Remember though‚Ä¶it is a steakhouse!!! The starter of sticky chipotle chicken is amazing, T-bone steak (medium/rare) is fantastic and apple crumble with custard is just excellent! Our server Ryan was extremely polite, helpful and very professional! The whole experience was amazing! üåü ‚≠êÔ∏è üí´"
UNALOME by Graeme Cheevers,5,"Delicious lunch with dishes of the highest standard coupled with excellent service. They create a lovely atmosphere which is relaxed and fun but still focussed on all the little details which you would expect from a Michelin rated restaurant. Comparing it to other similar places we‚Äôve tried it really nailed this balance. The food was fantastic, allowing excellent ingredients to shine."
UNALOME by Graeme Cheevers,5,"We had the Six course tasting menu with premium paired wines. I‚Äôve eaten in a lot of Michelin restaurants and Graeme and his team have got it just right. Elegant and stylish setting and superb service, without the stiff over formal atmosphere. It was welcoming and relaxed, the flavours and textures were intelligently combined and paired perfectly with some sublime wines. The staff were well informed and very professional. Quite possibly the best culinarily experience I‚Äôve ever had. Thank you Unalome! You made our valentines night unforgettable."
UNALOME by Graeme Cheevers,5,"Absolutely fabulous restaurant‚Ä¶ great local ingredients, seafood is always amazing. The mix of different flavours is smashing, it‚Äôs a real treat and in a great venue. Both lunch and evening menus have a great variety and all delicious. The service is easily the best I‚Äôve experienced, the staff are willing to do what they can for you. On this occasion, lunch, we got a matching wine set created for us and a cheese board‚Ä¶. It you‚Äôre looking for a treat  this is a must visit."
UNALOME by Graeme Cheevers,5,Went on a Friday night for the tasting menu and wine pairing. Food was borderline faultless with great service and interesting wine pairings. Up there with the best tasting menus/meals I‚Äôve had in 2023!
UNALOME by Graeme Cheevers,5,"My first Michelin experience in Glasgow. I enjoyed everything, especially the foie gras, sea bass and the dessert. They also have amazing bread with creamy butter!

What impresses me most is that they prepared a surprised petit four for me: when chatting I said I came to Glasgow for my first job and it has been just one month. At the end of my meal, staffs came with congratulations!! It‚Äôs quite warm and I‚Äôm quite grateful for it.

Their foods are of good balance so that you won‚Äôt feel too heavy, friendly service and kind staffs, will come back again!"
Eighty Eight,5,If you haven‚Äôt eaten at eighty eight what are you waiting for?! We visited today and the food (sharing plates) and dessert were delicious and so were the cocktails. Managed to get a pic of dessert but not the main meal as it disappeared very quickly. This place is definitely a new favourite. Would highly recommend üëåüèΩ
Eighty Eight,5,"We had a wonderful meal at this small but cozy restaurant. The food was excellent - bold and full flavours. We love a sharing concept and had 10 plates in total for our group of four. The plates came out at a steady pace, we never felt rushed. Small but good wine selection. The staff was exceptionally friendly and welcoming. We went to other, more expensive restaurants in Glasgow but this was by far our favorite. We spent 245 pounds which included 3 bottles of wine - a very fair price. Absolutely recommend this spot, we will definitely visit again next time we're in the area."
Eighty Eight,5,"Used some vouchers that were actually bought for the sister restaurant but decided on Eighty eight.
It did not disappoint. Great food and great portions"
Eighty Eight,5,"This is a lovely little place in the West End of Glasgow. It does small menus and small plates, but everything that comes out of the small kitchen is delicious. Service is friendly and informed. Booking is essential.
We went on a pasta special menu evening."
Eighty Eight,5,Incredible coffee and even better pastries! They have the most gorgeous cups and the atmosphere is really cosy! I personally loved that you were offered a choice of single origin for your coffee and the menu included tasting notes to help you choose. I am keen to return to try out their selections of wine one evening!
Ka Pao Glasgow,5,"Nice restaurant found almost by chance during my visit in Glasgow.
It‚Äôs an Asian inspired cuisine and they recommended to take 3-4 small dishes to share and one or two ‚Äúmain courses‚Äù with some side dishes.
That‚Äôs what we did and we found the food very delicious! I really recommend the corn ribs and the fried mushrooms, so good!
We‚Äôll definitely visit this place again because there are still so much dishes to try on their inviting menu. Great service, it was all perfect!
We spent around 85 pounds in two and we left full and satisfied"
Ka Pao Glasgow,5,"Outstanding.  My general rule is if I do not understand the menu items, I do not eat at the restaurant.  This place is one of the few exceptions.  It was chosen by my friend at the recommendation of a local.  The menu is unique and contains many flavor profiles and items that I have never experienced.  We trusted the chef and went with the sharing menu.  The chef is a real artist who put together robust flavors of seemingly strange or unknown ingredients that really complemented each other.  Dont overthink it.  Have a little faith and try these unique creations.  This is New York, LA, Vegas, Paris quality food in Glasgow.  Plenty of food and reasonably priced."
Ka Pao Glasgow,5,"genuinely some of the nicest food i‚Äôve had in the longest time. i came here for my birthday dinner and enjoyed every single aspect of it. the fried oyster mushrooms were enlightening. the beef tartare was otherworldly and honestly, it‚Äôs been two weeks and i‚Äôve been craving it ever since then. the mussels were delicious, and we ordered a side of rice and spooned the juice from the mussels on top, incredible hack, was absolutely delicious. the beef skewers genuinely made me see god. perfectly grilled and just the most flavorful tender meat. the corn ribs were a first for me, but it was love at first bite. why isn‚Äôt corn always served like this? besides being easier to eat, utterly beautiful flavor. and finally, the fried chicken with the caramel glaze. my partner and i argued for the longest time over how you were able to achieve chicken that is THAT crispy, while still remaining juicy. even after 10-15 minutes of sitting on our table, drenched in the glaze/sauce‚Ä¶..you would think that the crispiness would start to fade. you think it might get a bit soggy. guess again. you bite into it, and it‚Äôs still JUST as crispy as when it arrived to the table. how do you guys do it???? actually, don‚Äôt tell me. i prefer to imagine you as little wizard chefs producing the best birthday dinner i‚Äôve had in a very long time. i visited on march 14th around 6/6:30pm, and everyone who served us was an absolute dream.

also!!! the entire restaurant was super clean, looked very cool and the most important‚Ä¶the bathrooms were spotless!!

thank you guys for such an amazing dinner ü©∑"
Ka Pao Glasgow,5,"Omg the food is amazing! I can be a bit nervous about trying new foods but virtually every dish (my group basically passed around every dish we ordered so we could all try it) was amazing! The oyster mushrooms in particular were delicious. The staff were so lovely and patient. The entire setup of the restaurant is so pretty.

My one complaint would be that I hated paying ¬£4 for a glass bottle of coca-cola ü§£ but honestly everything was so lovely. I'll definitely be back."
Ka Pao Glasgow,5,"The food at Ka Pao is second to none. We asked our server for recommendations and they didn't disappoint. I love that the food comes out as and when it is ready which allows you to graze at your own pace. The flavours in each dish were delicious and the presentation was impeccable. Service was excellent, very friendly interactions with three staff members left us feeling attended to and appreciated. We will definitely be returning."
G≈çst,5,"Wow! This place is absolutely stunning inside. First visit here today. Great menu, portion sizes are decent which I love, we had intended on a desert, however after ordering our sides (the mac and cheese and onion rings the best I have tried in a while) we couldn't move so opted for coffee instead üòÄ.  I had the scallops and pork belly to start, I'm not normally a fan of pork, this was first class! My friend had the croquettes  and we both had the roast dinner (with it being Sunday after allüòÄüòã cooked to perfection. Nicole and Joseph who served us where both lovely, friendly and efficient. The place opens at 1pm on Sunday just a few of us in, then all of a sudden it was packed. We had booked it and I would definitely recommend doing that. Great upbeat vibes and background music. Definitely worth every penny. Just go üòÄ"
G≈çst,5,"Absolutely fantastic festive lunch. Started with a simple
Booking process, the restaurant was very accommodating to our various needs - we were a group of 23. Food was tremendous, very tasty, good time between courses and plenty of it üòÇ. Staff looked after the whole group very well, no long waiting that you would expect at this time of year. Drinks were excellent too, great selection of cocktails. We will be back.. cheers"
G≈çst,5,"Wine & steak were delicious (although the whiskey cream sauce was a little light on the whiskey, although still very tasty) and staff were very friendly and welcoming. The smoked bone marrow served in the bone with caramelised onions on top was wonderful too.
My photo doesn't do it justice!"
G≈çst,5,Best steak restaurant in Glasgow. Service from Andrew was wonderful. We were greeted to a lovely booth and the atmosphere was spot on. The food was that good we managed to squeeze in a dessert üòÑ
G≈çst,5,"Delighted with my experience at Gosht restaurant! Introducing a friend to Scotland, I sought a quality halal steakhouse, and Gosht exceeded expectations. The ambience was lovely, service warmly welcoming. The sirloin steak was a revelation‚Äîundeniably the best I've ever had, incredibly juicy. The mocktails were beautifully crafted. While it leaned towards the pricey side, the exceptional fine dining experience made it worthwhile for special occasions. A special shout-out to Ellie, Rueben, and the talented chef who made our evening memorable on Friday, 26th January."
Kimchi Cult,5,"Updated review after the menu change.

The fried chicken on the bone is gone and has been replaced with fried chicken thighs without the bone but with the same amazing flavours as before. It will take me time to process the change but these new chicken thighs taste great but they will never live up to the fried chicken from before. R.I.P Kimchi Cult Fried Chicken. Sad times.

We tried the pizza and as tasty as it is it just somehow doesn't fit with the menu in my eyes. The flavours are great and even with my disdain for deep pan pizzas they still were tasty ""pizzas"".

I'll update the review once I get a chance to try the new bibmbapbox."
Kimchi Cult,4,"The food was great, the chicken was wonderful(light and crispy)! Love the soy chicken, gochujang chicken was a little sour but was good, the bibimbap is a must! And the burger.. is a burgerüòÖ I should've tried the chicken burger cause their chicken is a mustry!  The restaurant is small but it's nice and cozy."
Kimchi Cult,2,"We were previously regularly getting the fried chicken as it was cooked very tasty and it had a distinctive crispy skin. Unfortunately, after the recipe recently changed, it seems the restaurant now uses breast meat instead of thigh meat, the previous crisp that gave the food it's character is lost. If the new product was what I wanted, I would have bought KFC! Disappointed as the old style chicken was one of my favourite dishes."
Kimchi Cult,3,"Not sure if I ordered the wrong thing but my burger tasted like nothing. The kimchi on it was good, but that was all.
The bread is too soft and disappeared in my hand.
The chicken burger was a little bit better, but just very regular. Nothing special.
The whole place is messy with things everywhere, gives you an impression that they are desperate for a deep clean."
Kimchi Cult,5,"5 stars for the food alone and 5 stars for service as it's self-service. Order from the machine on the wall and take a seat if you can find one. Great to share seating with strangers and meet new people.

The menu is changing soon, so you can't get a better time to go in and try their amazing fried chicken.

I used to go to Kimchi Cult when they where in London and the qaulity of food hasn't changed one bit. Best Korean BBQ in Glasgow by far."
Murphy‚Äôs Pakora Bar,5,"Stunning food, brilliant service and really reasonable prices.

We‚Äôve been twice now and both times have been incredible. Highly recommend!

Raj is a king amongst men."
Murphy‚Äôs Pakora Bar,5,"What an excellent  move this was tonight after visiting Riverside museum.A friend had told me that this place a haunt of old days had been refurbed and reopened. So today was an excellent opportunity  to revisit after years of absence.The menu is excellent .There is much more than Pakora to choose from. There are many items not available  in the more traditional  indian eateries.  After the obligatory Poppadums  and spiced onions,we had very unusual, sweetcorn and red pepper pakora and some really excellent Masala tatties both served with delicious  dips. We then shared an amazing Aloo Gobi
( Cauliflower  and Potato) and a very tasty Coconut  Chicken Korma. Paratha was also perfect. The staff were really, so helpful and friendly.  Really lovely people who answered our many questions  regarding
Ingredients  and menu contentüòä
Love the Tuk Tuk in the entrance  vestibule. Took me back to my many trips to Goa  Price was very reasonable  at ¬£44 for our satisfying  feast. Thoroughly  recommended. ü§ó"
Murphy‚Äôs Pakora Bar,4,"Quite nice, both the pakora starters and the mains (chicken korma and lamb rogan josh). I appreciated the care in asking for allergies and was told pakoras are fried separately for gluten free customers."
Murphy‚Äôs Pakora Bar,5,"Came here to celebrate my 23rd birthday with friends. Amazing atmosphere and service. Lovely chat, and energy from the owner and his members of staff. Highly recommend to anyone looking for some great Indian street food-at an amazing price!"
Murphy‚Äôs Pakora Bar,4,Mixed feelings on this one. It‚Äôs not a casual hang out bar with Indian based snacks on the side and it‚Äôs also not a fully fledged Indian restaurant. I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs the best recipe for getting a great experience. Service a highlight and was friendly and with old school Glaswegian charm. Food was tasty but not mind blowing and the menu is fairly succinct. Decor is comfortable and modern. If your not wanting a full on meal it‚Äôs worth a try
La Lanterna,3,"Went for a valentine's night dinner, and despite the high praises I have heard about this restaurant, the experience was pretty lackluster. The dinner service was restricted to their set menu for Valentine's day and one could opt for a 2 course meal for 27.50 each or 3 course for 35 each.
My partner ordered a mains and a dessert sharing platter, and I went for a prawn starter and mains. The menu did not state that if you share the dessert platter it will cost extra and after we were reassured by the service staff that it wont be charged separately, when it came down to the billing time, there was an extra 7.5 quid added on top of our 27.50 each. There was also an added service charge, automatically added on top of that, both seems disingenuous to me. I don't mind paying service fee and having worked in the hospitality industry I will gladly hand tips to servers, but this was not acceptable. The extra charge for sharing dessert platter makes no sense, 'cos essentially my partner paid 35 quid for a bowl of pasta and 4 shot glasses worth of desserts.
We were told that the server did not know and she explained it to us incorrectly that it would be included in the price, and only after asking for clarification was one given to us. She also quickly went on to say that she would be happy to take off the service fee, as if doing us a favor while admitting to the fact that she gave us misinformation while taking the order. The whole situation left a bitter after taste, although the main course pasta was pretty good. The dessert platter portion wise was very disappointing especially considering the extra charge.
Food was decent, I liked my risotto but the whole billing experience did not leave me with a positive impression of the place."
La Lanterna,5,"My partner and I visited here after seeing rave reviews online. For starters, we shared a ""Fritura Mista"" which is a mix of calamari, king prawns, white bait, and courgette served with a garlic mayo dip. It was flawless. Quality seafood, seasoned perfectly and so fresh.

For our mains, I had crab ravioli in a lobster claw meat sauce. My partner had a seafood risotto. Again, the seafood in both were of a very high standard, fresh, and both were seasoned to perfection.

For dessert, I had ""passione cioccolato"" - an award winning New York style chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream, which was fantastic.

Overall, we couldn't have been much more impressed with the experience. Staff were friendly and attentive, the service was prompt, and the food was outstanding. It's the best Italian restaurant we've been to and we will definitely be back"
La Lanterna,5,"what truly sets this restaurant apart is its attention to detail, particularly in its use of mirrors. Mirrors line the walls, reflecting the soft glow of candlelight and creating an atmosphere of intimacy and sophistication. It's like dining in a fairytale palace, where every corner holds a new surprise and every glance in the mirror reveals another layer of beauty.

But it's not just about aesthetics; the mirrors also serve a practical purpose. They make the space feel larger and more open, creating the illusion of endless possibilities. And let's not forget about the practical benefits of mirrors in a restaurant setting‚Äîthey help guests feel more comfortable and confident, allowing them to check their appearance discreetly without interrupting the flow of conversation.

I even wrote a short poem because I was so inspired!

In mirrors' silvered sheen, reflections dance,
A symphony of images, a fleeting glance.
They capture moments, both joy and sorrow,
Echoes of yesterday, hopes for tomorrow.

In mirrored depths, secrets lie concealed,
Whispers of truths, yet to be revealed.
They reflect the soul, in its purest form,
A window to the heart, in the quiet storm.

In mirrors, we find beauty's embrace,
A reflection of grace, in every face.
They magnify dreams, and fears they betray,
In the mirror's gaze, we find our way.

So cherish the mirrors, both old and new,
For within their glass, lies a world anew.
In their silent depths, we find our truth,
Mirrors, oh mirrors, eternal youth.

Absolutely Lavish ü´∂üèªü´∂üèªü´∂üèª"
La Lanterna,4,"My wife and I had chicken and mushroom risotto, lasagna, and calamari for a starter. The risotto and calamari were great. The lasagna was good, too, but the sauce perhaps a bit burnt, giving the lasagna a smokie taste. The servers were attentive even with the large number of guests and the atmosphere cozy."
La Lanterna,5,"Wonderful place.
Excellent food. Great service.,
Special shot out for the Mussels, which we had a shared starter.
The Spaghetti Arragosta was very good."
Piccolo Mondo,5,"The food are amazing! And the service is super!!! Special thanks to the Chinese lady in the restaurant for excellent service, also the gentleman who helped me with the wine! The service is just amazing!"
Piccolo Mondo,5,"¬£14.5 for 2 course. I chose main and dessert.   I ordered cheese cake . It is too creamy and not much cheese taste. A bit disappointed.

2nd visited for dinner on 28Dec 2023.
We chose the Pre-theatre Mena. We ordered starter and main course. Everything is good. I like the prawn cocktail and calamari fritti."
Piccolo Mondo,5,"We had such a lovely lunch...

The food was great. I liked the decor.  The toilets  are impeccable..

Frankly, I can cook at home. When I go out, I want good food...of course....but I really want to feel welcome. For me, the  sense of hospitality is extremely  important.
So, I want to be greeted, seated, and well- served. And that's  exactly  what happened...

The Staff are lovely...professional..and we thoroughly  enjoyed our meal."
Piccolo Mondo,5,Absolutely fantastic place food is delicious and staff are pleasant and friendly
Piccolo Mondo,4,"Very busy, very good food. Good attention and staff helpful and managed very well though busy. Short walk from Glasgow city centre, and convenient for rail and bus. Also do a great lunchtime deal. Very popular. Award winning restaurant over many years. Make sure you book for the evening."
Chaophraya,5,"I really enjoyed a fantastic meal here with excellent food of high quality. We ordered the set menu which was ¬£43 per person. We got a very good mixture of starters, three main meals and rice, followed by a chocolate mousse for dessert.  The food was very very tasty. The building and restaurant area were exquisitely decorated all Thai themed."
Chaophraya,5,"This was my first time here.  The food was great, the atmosphere was relaxed, all the staff were nice. Will be visiting again.  We went for the 3 coarse lunch menu. With a couple of add on's prawn crackers and 2 egg fried rice to accompany our main dishes and 2 large wines we paid ¬£84 for 2 people."
Chaophraya,5,"My first time here after hearing so much about it.
Out with friends after work and dined on the early evening menu. Chicken satay to start was a large fulfilling portion followed by spicy beef salad.
The salad had a warmth and slight kick to it, but simply delicious.
Cannot wait to return again!"
Chaophraya,5,"We stumbled upon Chaophraya while exploring Glasgow. It stands out as a gastronomic gem, offering the tastiest and most flavourful dishes we've ever had.

The authentic decor and vibes added an extra layer of enjoyment, creating an immersive experience that transported us to the heart of Asia. The genuine atmosphere complemented the outstanding culinary offerings.

Highly recommend for anyone seeking an unparalleled Asian dining experience that combines exceptional flavours with authentic ambiance."
Chaophraya,4,"The entrance and interior decor of the restaurant are quite splendid, creating a fantastic ambiance. Booking a table in advance over the phone is very convenient. The flavor of the dishes is comparable to Ting Thai in the West End, but the prices are 2-3 times higher. This Thai restaurant in Glasgow is the only one offering Mongo Sticky Rice with Coconut Milk and Pineapple Rice, adding a unique touch. Lamb curry was average, and the portion sizes are rather small. A service charge of 12.5% is applied, which falls in the mid-range. The staff is reasonably friendly."
The Hug and Pint,4,"Was here to hear Gasper Nail who is from Malawi with a group of friends great little venue, not sure what his instrument was, he was joined for some of the time by his manager on guitar"
The Hug and Pint,5,"One of the great small venues and places to eat in Glasgow. Good selection of beers, I love that they have a tiny menu of great food that they change, when we were there we had chickpea curry with jasmine rice, daal and potato bits. All of it was really top rate!"
The Hug and Pint,5,"Was in at the weekend for a gig. And must say I was very happy with the place, being Coeliac I liked that they have a range of gluten free food and drink. I even talked to the chef, kitchen is adjacent to the bar, and he and the rest of the staff seemed full understand food allergens.

Will be back"
The Hug and Pint,5,"**Edit** Staff have changed over the past year and now they have a new menu. Good but overpriced for what it is. After learning how music acts are treated in this venue- ¬£50 between a whole band and charged for having a merch table - Im less inclined..

Love this place! Really unique vegan asian tapas-style grub - be an adventurous eater when you come here and you won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
The Hug and Pint,2,"Nice enough place that was decorated well. The bar staff were nice but I felt they could have been a bit more friendlier, but they weren't unpleasant at all. We didn't order food as we were there for a gig but I noticed that in the open kitchen the chef was heating up portions of food in the microwave before it was presented to the table. Nobody that was eating seemed to mind but I just thought if I was going for a meal I would prefer for it to be freshly cooked. The drinks were very expensive and I was a bit shocked at the price. The downstairs venue was good for the gig but I could imagine it would be very cramped if sold out. They had painted the door and some wooden boxing around the room. It did have signs saying wet paint but it was hard to avoid and the girlfriend ended up with paint on her jeans. Great gig but I wouldn't go back and definitely not for food and drink."
The butterfly and the pig,4,"Decided on The Butterfly and the Pig for Sunday lunch because it looked interesting. Service was pleasant with Lauren but even BETTER when she handed us off to another server who had an amazing sense of humor, sadly didn't get her name.
Mushroom fritters shouldn't be missed! Perfectly crisp and outstanding flavor! Love the tiny bit of spice that develops as you enjoy the bite.
Sunday roast with sirloin wasn't hot, just barely warm even cold in places of dish, but still yummy with horseradish. The accompanying carrots were OUTSTANDING! Steak pie was beautiful and perfectly tender, order with mash, you won't  be disappointed!
If you're not from the UK, make note, if you want to dine in the restaurant, you must make a reservation, however, you may eat in the bar area, which is just as nice."
The butterfly and the pig,4,The food was fantastic! The Colin Coley and cauliflower veggie appetizer was fantastic! The sticky toffee pudding was OK. We need a bigger plate and moist pudding. We also created some ambience by lighting our candle. The steak pie looks delicious. My partner and his friend said it was good. We will return!
The butterfly and the pig,5,"Lovely wee place with loads of mismatched tea-sets and teapots! Very cosy and the food was great. You could order the Afternoon Tea (which was NOT expensive for an afternoon tea; I was expecting to pay almost double before I saw the menu) or you could get regular breakfast food, like a really nice Eggs Benedict or French Toast. These were all delicious according to the group I was with! Would definitely recommend, especially if you'd like to bring someone for a nice Afternoon Tea and chat!"
The butterfly and the pig,4,"I have visited twice now for the Sunday roast. The space has an interesting aesthetic, with different vibes at each part of it, so I highly recommend you book online beforehand, as this gets you a seat at the prettiest tables, behind the curtain, with freshly ironed white tablecloths and candle holders. The food is quite tasty, we tried the tomato soup, the roasted vegetables, the Sunday roast and the meat pie. However, one star is redacted because the meat pie came in cookware with peeling ceramic coating, which can potentially be hazardous for health and not something I wanted to worry about on a Sunday (or any other day)."
The butterfly and the pig,3,"Food was okay, as the steak which we ordered medium rare came out as well done, while there was a wee bit too much salt on the risotto. The former was rectified with a replacement steak, and not being charged for it (totally surprised). Happy with the recovery by the team, so +1 ‚≠ê to the team.

Honestly felt that the waitress was condescending when we asked to take the food orders after the drinks came. She said ""There are other tables that we are waiting to take orders first, but we can take yours"". Honestly an unnecessary comment if you aren't interested in taking our order. Totally could sense her unhappiness in being asked to take an order after that.

Surprisingly quiet on a Fri night!"
Santa Lucia Merchant City Glasgow,5,"Wow! Bustling atmosphere, amazing and attentive staff, great choice of menu and food was the best we have had in a long time. We have been to Naples, we know how good the pizzas are there and I must say Santa Lucia catapulted us back there with their authentic food! I heard great things and my expectations were high...Santa Lucia did not disappoint! A truly wonderful evening with my family to celebrate my birthday and we can't wait to come back. Thank you team Santa Lucia! X"
Santa Lucia Merchant City Glasgow,5,"Gorgeous place! The food, service, and atmosphere were a 10/10. The staff were the friendliest and most welcoming I've experienced in a long time. The food was so delicious, comforting, and full of flavour! This would be our regular if we lived in Glasgow! We will be back!"
Santa Lucia Merchant City Glasgow,5,"It was our first visit to Santa Lucia Merchant City and definitely won't be our last! The food was incredible! Everyone enjoyed every dish from starters, pastas, pizzas and desserts. The service was very friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is really lovely. We had a great dinner thank you!"
Santa Lucia Merchant City Glasgow,5,"Visited Santa Lucia for the first time this Saturday evening. The restaurant is welcoming and looks great both inside and out. We were greeted by very friendly and professional staff when we arrived and seated promptly. The service was excellent all night - fast, attentive and friendly. Special mention to our server Keira who was lovely and checked in regularly for drinks and to check if the food was all ok.

Moving on to the food, it was some of the best Italian food we have had in a long time in Glasgow. We shared some starters, mains and desserts. Everything was great and you could tell each dish had been thought through. The menu is not huge, but there is enough of a selection that there is something for everyone.

Can't wait to return and highly recommend people go and try here if you have not already - you won't be disappointed."
Santa Lucia Merchant City Glasgow,5,"Ok has to be said absolutely lovely setting in Santa Lucia the decor is beautiful bright and airy fantastic reception as we walked in from the head waiter very attentive staff but haven‚Äôt got to the good part as yet the food
We had muscles and lentil soup followed by the sea bass and chicken milenese all very fresh ingredients and flavours were on point
We were served by Paulina very helpful staff member and fantastic mannerisms
We‚Äôd highly recommend going and trying this little gem for yourselves
Looking forward to another visit very soon
Thanks
Santa Lucia"
Gaucho Glasgow,5,"We had the most amazing meal and afternoon at Gaucho if I could give 10 stars I would!  Took my mum here for her birthday and honestly could not fault a thing.  The food was just fabulous. Everything was so fresh and tasty. The Sea Bass Ceviche is a must try! I've had Trout Ceviche before but Gaucho's Sea Bass Ceviche is on another level! Absolutely delicious. Service was also exceptional. The staff are so welcoming and can't do enough for you. The management team, Ryan and Anton, ensured that my mum had a lovely birthday dining experience. As a wee special touch the chef decorated my mum's dessert with a happy birthday message which was so thoughtful and a lovely birthday surprise for her. The girl who served our table, I think her name was Olivia, also provided a 5 star service.  The actual restaurant itself is just beautiful. It is immaculate and has a really sophisticated but chilled vibe that you just can't help feeling relaxed in.  We absolutely can't wait to go back and the fact that it's dog friendly I will maybe be bringing my wee furry dog pal next time! üòÑ Thank you so much to all the team at Gaucho for a wonderful afternoon you really do provide a friendly and first class city centre dining experience! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Gaucho Glasgow,5,"All 5 of us had a wonderful dining experience tonight.
All the staff were exceptional but a special shout out for Olivia, who did most of the service for our table.
The food was exceptional and all staff well briefed on the menu options."
Gaucho Glasgow,5,"Sunday bliss at Gaucho  üçΩÔ∏è  we started with some cocktails at the bar before indulging in a delightful lunch with friends. Our booth was spacious and perfect for our gathering. The steaks were cooked to perfection, tailored to our individual tastes, accompanied by a great choice of sides and sauces. One friend opted for a steak salad, which was a hit! Our waiter's wine expertise added an extra touch to the experience, guiding us to the perfect pairings. Overall, it was a fantastic day filled with great food, drinks, and company. Highly recommend!"
Gaucho Glasgow,5,"Came here for two special occasions -- birthday and anniversary -- and both meals were spectacular. The steak is among the best in Glasgow, and the appetizers and cocktails simply elevate the experience to an entirely other level. Definitely try the truffle arancini!"
Gaucho Glasgow,4,"We love meat!
So we came hear with expectations. Unfortunately, one of steaks we ordered (raw) was more like medium rare. But the service immediately reacted and gave us a 50% discount at the end. Unexpected but very positive indeed.
The interior is just amazing. High class location.
Coming from Germany, having a glass of wine for 20 pound is, say, something not very common but it was really worth it. So, listen to the recommendations you‚Äôll get.
All in all it was a great time we had at the Gaucho. Thank you, Sam!"
The Spanish Butcher Glasgow,5,"Restaurant has a lovely interior. The food was delicious and the steak perfectly cooked. The smoked salmon starter was a bit bland and presentation was odd. The panacotta was really good though. The service was quite disappointing in comparison to the food, and not very attentive. Overall a good option for a special occasion."
The Spanish Butcher Glasgow,5,"Take their lunch set menu: street corn is amazing! However, the rump steak is just okay - good but not that surprising. Almond tart is good also they have a good red wine from Rioja.

I will come back to try other types of steak :)"
The Spanish Butcher Glasgow,5,"What a incredible experience from the moment we arrived (albeit the table wasn't ready but that's ok)
I believe our server was Stefano, this guy needs a raise! He had so much knowledge of the menu from the steaks and the flavours, sides, sauces and how the bone marrow is cooked.

He went above and beyond.
The steak for our party of 4 (one had a burger but was equally very happy with it!) Was cooked to perfection and how we asked for it.
Bone marrow for me was a let down, underwhelming but that's a personal preference as I'm not sure what flavour I expected.
Otherwise I highly recommend this place for a good steak and truffle fries.

Perhaps offer truffle fries with the burger too though? Think they miss out with the skinny fries instead!
Thank you Stefano for such a pleasant experience, just wish the tip went directly to him!

Pictured is the bone marrow and scotch fillet. Others had the galacian which they said was well worth the money."
The Spanish Butcher Glasgow,5,"Great little restaurant and bar. We only stayed for a couple of cocktails and some oysters (which were top notch), but all the food looked incredible. Staff were very friendly as well.

The old fashioned with Pedro Xim√©nez sherry was incredible.

Can't wait to come back and try the food next time."
The Spanish Butcher Glasgow,5,"The food was absolutely amazing and I will definitely be returning soon. If you're looking for outstanding food and impeccable service, this is the place to go."
The Finnieston,5,Stunning experience from start to finish - attentive waiting staff. Incredible oysters and lobster. Wine list was amazing - do you need anything else in life? ;)
The Finnieston,5,"Great quality good portions and dog friendly what more could you ask for??

In case you do bring your dog, the rat traps are humane. Which can make them rather tasty for your dog should they go hunting under your chairs"
The Finnieston,5,"Had a wonderful birthday meal. First time trying lobster, and loved it. Oysters were perfect too.
Lovely staff and cosy atmosphere."
The Finnieston,5,We had an amazing lunch. I had the best fish and chips I‚Äôve ever had. Seriously. Huge portion of fish perfectly fried. Nice crunchy but light batter. The chips were amazing. My wife had a selection of their starters and all were excellent.
The Finnieston,4,"Last minute walk in with friends . Just had a few drinks and some delicious chips.
Service  from host to waitress was tremendous.  No faults and area outside with heaters was very pleasant.
Food on the next table looked delicious so will be back to try a meal.
Well done to the hard-working staff  - not easy in hospitality at the moment üëç"
La Vita,4,"Food was an authentic. I love it. I ordered spaghetti carbonara, calamari fried, and gelatos. But the only thing need to be improved is the staffs were not nice as they should be, no smiling, ask frequently for keep dish back even the food did not empty."
La Vita,5,"I've been going to La Vita for years, and I still absolutely love it. The restaurant is in a brilliant location overlooking George Sq, the food as always is great! The only letdown (this visit only) was that the server wasn't very personal and didn't look interested at all. It might have been an off day, but that's the first time this has happened. The ma√Ætre d' on arrival was very welcoming. He was happy to have a little chat with before we got to our table. I'd happily go back anytime"
La Vita,4,"Italian food with lots of options.
Got the garlic bread for starter but they‚Äôre a bit burnt but still nice, also got calamari, which wasn‚Äôt fried enough for our liking, the haggis arancini didn‚Äôt have much flavour.

The tagliatelle calabrese is very nice lots of sauce and sausage, very flavourful! I really recommend this! My friend had the Quattro stagioni which she found alright. I love how you can get half pasta here, very accommodating.

For dessert I had the chocolate covered strawberry tart. The tart is quite dense, is massive portion, I had a lot of whip cream in the middle. My friend got the cheese cake which looking amazing but she found it too sweet.

Tried the festive cocktail merry kiss mas, it was very sweet, if you have a sweet tooth it‚Äôs be perfect for you. The clausmopolitan is nice. I love the cocktail menu here, you have so many options to choose from.

The menu is big with good varieties. There‚Äôs plenty of seatings but not much leg room upstairs, the corridors are narrow, the decor is very festive, Craig who served us is great!"
La Vita,5,"Food was amazing. Location is perfect. Atmosphere is cozy.
Authentic Italian food."
La Vita,5,"A very warm and cosy environment. I went on Monday evening about 9pm, it was fairly busy. Staff were friendly and happy to help, the service was quick.

The mussels in white wine and cream were absolutely fantastic, and the inferno pizza was also brilliant. Will definitely be visiting again!"
Ralph & Finns,2,"Came here for lunch as a party of 3
One of our party ordered from the set menu
Myself and another person in the party ordered from the main menu
The other party members had the parfait for starter which they both liked
Myself I ordered the scallops unfortunately my scallops were over cooked I went with a safe option being the Camembert which was nice
However none of us enjoyed the mains one being beef ragu from the set menu
Again myself and another party member ordered from the main menu one being the double cheeseburger which was overcooked and again myself I had the lamb rolled shoulder which was tough
The staff were friendly and eager to resolve our issues
Sadly I do believe in first impressions and won‚Äôt be back"
Ralph & Finns,5,Lovely atmosphere. The burgers were delicious. The mash was star of the show though. Prices justified. Good date night location.
Ralph & Finns,5,"Lovely restaurant, spotlessly clean with an excellent staff. Went on a voucher that was a Christmas present. Choices were very good and the food was excellent. Will definitely be back. The deal to me wax very good value for money and I recommend checking it out. All in excellent."
Ralph & Finns,5,"It's been on our list to try... and we really enjoyed it. We ate using the 5pm market menu (2 courses for ¬£18). I had the cauliflower cheese and my partner had the chicken Kiev. For dessert we had sticky toffee pudding and creme brulee. Everything was really good and the service was great to be honest. Friendly, welcoming staff."
Ralph & Finns,5,"Beautiful. Food was so lovely, very flavoursome. Lovely vegetarian option.  Would highly recommend. Atmoshphere was chilled out and warm. Staff were pleasant and so attentive and friendly.
Lovely little room to have a whisky in after dinner too.
Worth a visit!!!"
Turkiye EFES Restaurant,5,Absolutely unbelievable food!! My partner and I got the sharing platter for 2 and it did not disappoint. The portion sizes are massive and this could have easily done 3-4 people but anything we left was boxed up for us by the staff who were lovely. They also have do great mocktails. We have spoke about Turkiye EFES ever since and can‚Äôt wait to come back!
Turkiye EFES Restaurant,5,"We were a party of 7 who were looking for a place to have dinner. This looked highly rated on an alternative ratings site so we gave it a shot. They accommodated us really well. Although it was busy and bustling they put together some table for us in a great spot, and brought our food in a timely manner. The portion sizes were generous and tasty. There were some vegetarian options, which sounded nice, but this is a place predominantly for meat eaters. The lampshades were an amazing colour. I thought the mains were good value ¬£19 to ¬£25 including rice and salad."
Turkiye EFES Restaurant,5,"Very nice restaurant. We turned up randomly and they were very accommodating finding us a table. The place was very nice and had belly dancers.

They were accommodating with allergies and helped me order as well as gave me gluten free bread with butter whilst waiting for our meal which I very much appreciated and pushed this rating to a 5.

The food was good and I‚Äôd defo recommend and would like to return again."
Turkiye EFES Restaurant,5,"Such a great place to enjoy delicious traditional Turkish food. Fantastic service, large menu, lots of favourites! Despite being very popular, atmosphere is not too loud. Large portions, shareable plates, plenty of extras. 100% recommend if you can't get to Turkiye for dinner üòâ"
Turkiye EFES Restaurant,5,"Everything was outstanding from start to finish. Definitely the best restaurant I‚Äôve been to in 2023, and I have been to A LOT! The sharing platters are a must, although on the pricier side it is well worth it for the quality and substantial portion sizes."
Alston Bar & Beef,5,"Often overlooked due to its somewhat unusual Central Station location, it‚Äôs also underrated. There aren‚Äôt many great steak restaurants in Glasgow and Alston is certainly up there with the best.

A somewhat quirky entrance leads you to a subterranean cellar venue with arches, marble and monochrome accents. Reminds me of a luxurious NY hotel or vintage gin bar.

Arriving on a damp, dull and thoroughly dreich Sunday we took advantage of the fairly priced set menu (2 courses ¬£25 / 3 courses ¬£30) and were not disappointed.

Portion size was ample and the beef was tender and rich. Vegetables all cooked perfectly and a decadent gravy pulling it all together and warming ones metaphorical cockles.

Desserts were beautifully plated and rounded off a comfortable, competent meal. Having been before and had some fantastic steak (et vino) I can heartily recommend."
Alston Bar & Beef,5,"This place is fantastic. Amazing roasts, great beers and the music was good too. Would very highly recommend."
Alston Bar & Beef,5,What a gorgeous quirky restaurant... A little hard to find as its in the entrance of the train station but the food was amazing... Loved the menu and the staff were very friendly and helpful when I asked them about the unusual cheese with figs on the starter menu... The chef actually brought us a big chunk of it with crackers to take home... So lovely and we'll be back üòä
Alston Bar & Beef,3,"Service was painfully slow. Our food took one hour to arrive. The restaurant was half empty. We ordered the chateaubriand to share. It was good, but not excellent. The portion of chips was tiny. Onion rings and scallops were excellent. The peppercorn sauce was like gravy from cat food."
Alston Bar & Beef,4,"Had the set menu, haggis croquettes lacking flavour. Ordered the d-rump medium rare, it was overcooked but the sauce and the chips are very good. Ganache as dessert is very good."
iasg,1,"RUDE. RUDE. RUDE bar staff and bartender. Friend came from Ireland so took her to a ""top"" hotel with a lovely bar... and that's where it stopped.
Bartender didn't even crack a smile. Was indifferent and bored. Wouldn't make the drink we wanted. Reluctantly made the drinks on the menu, which cost 14 quid each.
Bad experience and horrible service!"
iasg,5,"Celebrated my graduation here with my family and close friends. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the food was delicious and they even gave us a complimentary glass of Prosecco each for the special occasion! Would definitely come back and recommend eating here."
iasg,4,We had booked a 2 course champagne lunch (to use a voucher) only to be told they only served brunch on a Sunday - this was not made clear when I booked. One of the party was vegetarian (advised at the time of booking) and very little choice on the brunch menu for vegetarians although they did adapt a couple of dishes. Not sure we got the value of the voucher due to 'brunch type' dishes - poor dessert selection - again because this was a brunch menu and not a lunch menu
iasg,4,"My partner took us here for our Anniversary dinner, it‚Äôs beautiful inside. I ordered the soup as a starter which was fine, nothing special in my opinion. The burger was lovely but don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the ¬£15. Chocolate mousse was very nice. Staff were lovely, gave us both a glass of free champagne as it was a special occasion. Overall it was a lovely restaurant, maybe a little overpriced for some items on the menu but wasn‚Äôt too crazy."
iasg,4,"All staff following new guidelines, masks worn all the time, hand sanitizer everywhere and social distancing in force. Staff also prompted other diners to follow the rules...

Food was good, menu simple but well executed. Fish and chips were good. Small plates were interesting - chicken terrine was lovely and a generous salmon starter went down well.

Cocktails were good, staff happy to go off menu as well. Service was great as usual, happy to recommend"
Mharsanta - Scottish Restaurant & Bar,4,"I recently dined at this restaurant and had a truly phenomenal experience. The food was absolutely amazing, with flavors that danced on the palate and left me wanting more. We ordered two steaks, one medium rare and the other medium, but there was a slight mix-up as one came out rare and the other medium. Despite this minor hiccup, everything else about the meal was impeccable.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is simply stunning, creating a perfect backdrop for a delightful evening out. It strikes the right balance between elegance and comfort, making it an ideal spot for both casual and special occasions.

What really elevated our experience was the waiting staff. They were very nice, kind, and incredibly accommodating. Their attentive service made us feel welcomed and well cared for throughout our meal.

Overall, our dining experience was excellent, and I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for superb food and a wonderful atmosphere. The staff's professionalism and the overall ambiance are sure to make any visit memorable."
Mharsanta - Scottish Restaurant & Bar,5,"This was always on my to do list and finally was able to pop in at the weekend. Great selection of Scottish food lots of locally sourced ingredients. Best Cullen skink I‚Äôve had to date. Price wise really good they also to a set menu for 1, 2 or 3 courses which was greatly priced I think ¬£17.95 for 2 course and ¬£22.95 for 3? Service was great too everyone was really attentive and friendly."
Mharsanta - Scottish Restaurant & Bar,5,"Had dinner in the Mharsanta and wasn't disappointed.
Great atmosphere in the spacious restaurant. Lovely service from enthusiastic staff.
The food was delicious and ample portions and the Tennents lager was a piece of art.
Really enjoyed our evening meal at Mharsanta."
Mharsanta - Scottish Restaurant & Bar,5,"Amazing service by Abby! Our first time in Glasgow, came across this local place as  the best Scottish restaurant in GLA. The food was delicious! Haggis pakora, black pudding scotch, beef pie and barbecue chicken were all outstanding! 25% off the menu on February too so even more enticing! Will come back!"
Mharsanta - Scottish Restaurant & Bar,5,"Best steak and sausage pie, great portion and very filling! Service was quick and steady with not long waiting time. Would highly recommend coming here for some food if you are visiting Glasgow."
Brel,4,"Food was barely OK, not impressive, as average as it can be. Service was nice and efficient.
Their location within Ashton lane, the nice garden & indoor service area are the highlight here I would say, very cozy and welcoming loved my table and they are dogs friendly."
Brel,4,"Gorgeous interior giving off a European pub and beer garden vibe, with indoor and outdoor seating. The interior was cozy. We went on Tuesday and it was a fondue and raclette night! Was fun to self-prep the cheese. The fondue was okay to share between 2 people. It was a good experience but the platter was quite basic. The service was average, very friendly but I think they were a bit stretched in staffing."
Brel,5,"Went to Brel for a birthday meal and had a great time. Seated in the terrace and although the weather was not the best the heaters, food & atmosphere made up for this. Kids loved it and Coco had a great time as well."
Brel,3,"Bring blankets, but not your appetite! Dined here for the new Sunday roast for two, but literally had to ask the server if another plate was coming. The temp inside was Baltic, but they did provide blankets -- and the fondue gravy also provided have warmth. The portion was small, and the meat cool, and it tasted like the potatoes had been cooked from frozen."
Brel,5,Went here on st Patrick‚Äôs day. Was pleasantly surprised we could use our it is on voucher this day. Loved the food. The staff were very helpful and the value for money was fantastic. Something really different for us and we really enjoyed it. Would recommend and return for sure.
111 by Modou,4,"Enjoyed the 5 course ""Total Trust"" menu, excellent food and value at ¬£25. Couple of small points, coffee came before dessert and no teaspoon with coffee, slightly nippy waitress when asked for teaspoon and dessert. Was overcharged by ¬£30 on bill (Inspire instead of Trust), sorted out okay. Rest of staff were really nice. Would recommend."
111 by Modou,5,Loved it. Did a 10 course tasting menu and guessed the dishes too. I would say im a BIT picky but i LOVED 9 out of 10 of the dishes (i just hate mince pies!) Would have personally liked to have each course served faster. Definitely recommend. Something different.
111 by Modou,5,We went for the total trust menu (¬£25 on a sunday) for 5 courses which you dont know in advance. The food was brilliant the service was brilliant. We will be back for sure.
111 by Modou,5,Very well presented and tasty dishes. And with the 10-course menu for ¬£30pp you simply can't go wrong! Staff is always friendly and helpful too.
111 by Modou,5,"Finlay, who attended us is so friendly, knowledgeable. He has provided exceptional service. The foods have always been fabulous. I always love Modou's creative menu. The attention to details and used of ingredients always surprise me. I have always know I will enjoy the food, the hospitality yesterday was first class."
Turtle Bay Glasgow,5,"My husband and I went here for the first time today. We arrived on time and were seated immediately. The red haired male server was very friendly and fun. Our server Dylan took over and took our drinks and lunch order.he did advise there might be a little wait for drinks as they were so busy. The place was jumping and had a bit of a party atmosphere - which was great at 2pm. The food was delicious, as were the cocktails. Everything was presented beautifully.  The staff were just lovely. Dylan was very attentive and helpful, as was the female with dark hair and glasses (sorry, didn't know the others names) we can't wait to come back"
Turtle Bay Glasgow,5,"We visited Turtle Bay on a quiet Wednesday afternoon. Somehow, despite there being few people around the place still managed to maintain a colorful, vibrant atmosphere. The decor really lends that West Indian feel, as do the sweet Reggae beats playing in the background.

The staff were friendly and attentive. Laura, our server was particularly nice... Top marks!

Food wise I wasn't sure what to expect as I've never tried Carribbean cuisine before. I was, it must be said, very impressed. My partner and I shared sweetcorn fritters and crispy squid for starters. For our mains I tried the Shack Stack burger, whilst the missus had the Kingston chicken with Mac and cheese... The food was dynamite! Couldn't recommend it any more.

If you're in the city and looking for some top grub come to Turtle Bay... You won't be disappointed."
Turtle Bay Glasgow,4,"Went here for a boozy brunch, which includes 5 cocktails and some food. The cocktails were amazing and stronger than we expected them to be as we thought they would mainly be fruit juice. The portions for the food were quite small but I think that was just because we had a restricted menu as part of the boozy brunch. Servers were very attentive and made sure we got our cocktails just as we were finishing the precious one. Overall the brunch and the cocktails are definitely worth the money and I will probably go back just for the cocktails."
Turtle Bay Glasgow,4,"Lovely food, friendly service, fun place!! It's a great addition to town and a vibrant venue to try something a little different with Caribbean flavours. I wasn't too impressed with the cocktails I tried but at least there are a lot of them and reasonable prices! I would definitely go back and try more food as I really liked it. The curries were great and the sweetcorn fritters are a must!"
Turtle Bay Glasgow,4,"The ambience is great. Food is delicious. Service is good. Just make sure you book a table in advance.
Although we didn't have a booking but the staff accommodated us. üòä"
Bar + Block Steakhouse Glasgow,4,"Have walked past this place many times and always wanted to try it. Took the chance this week and was not disappointed. From arrival friendly staff, although a feeling of 'chaos reigning'. Shown to our table, menus provided.  Took a bit of time to get orders given for drinks and then too have them delivered, but not in a hurry, so there no real issue. Food ordered and again delivered in fairly good time.

The quality of the food was first rate, but that is what I would expect, ur paying a premium.

Food issues. So I ordered a medium rate rib eye steak and got a steak that was one half medium rare, one half medium, but not much of an issue. As an extra ordered surf and turf, prawns option. Expected more than two prawns for the price.

So in all content, but felt a little ripped off.  You pay for everything as an extra.  Meat and chips included, but everything else (sauce/S&T) is extra. And when you are paying a premium, this seems a little over the top.

I enjoyed my visit and would happily go back but not at the price they wanted."
Bar + Block Steakhouse Glasgow,5,"I was there for my birthday with my dinner with my fiance & we had a couple of cocktails, lovely food & we shared a bottle of fizz, which was really nice. We had great service & the atmosphere was good as well. When we went into Bar + Block restaurant, there was a female singer on & she was really good. I would go back again, but maybe go for lunch during the day. Excellent restaurant & Excellent food."
Bar + Block Steakhouse Glasgow,5,"First time coming here for a meal, and I was very impressed. The food was amazing! The staff were lovely and welcoming too. This restaurant has a chilled family atmosphere and I look forward to returning again in the near future!"
Bar + Block Steakhouse Glasgow,4,"My first time going, o/h had been 3 or 4 times.with friends

The chicken, dear lord the chicken is absolutely beautiful/tender.  I always loved a half roast chicken but so many places stopped selling it.

O/h got the steak.

Others got the ultimate so the chicken, bit of beef, bit of lamb.  Our other guest had lamb.

Gravy pots are really small but can ask for more.  My roast potatoes were really drink but I got more gravy.

Got a side of pigs in blankets and the mushrooms.  So nice.

Water for the table, they didn't sell pepsi max (my fave) but do have diet coke.

We booked.

Toilets are upstairs but they have a disabled downstairs.

Beautiful interior, big, lovely design.

Staff really nice, repeat drinks took a while to come for with the food and it wasn't overly busy but otherwise great and would certainly go back 4.5/5.

They also have a boozy brunch style menu  ¬£30 for drinks (cocktails) and food, think I saw cheesy bites so we will need to check that out sometime."
Bar + Block Steakhouse Glasgow,5,"Every time we come to this Bar + Block we have a fantastic meal.
We've always found the staff to be professional, friendly and very helpful.
On this visit, we were greated by Waheed, a really nice guy from Egypt, who was very polite and friendly and likes to call you by your first name if your amenable for him to do so, which was refreshing. He couldn't do enough for us.
We decided to start with 4 small plates for ¬£21. They consisted of  Asian Crispy Beef (Tossed in hoisin, cucumber, spring onions, chilli and coriander), Garlic King Prawns (Cooked over charcoal with plenty of garlic butter, served with stonebaked flatbread), Salt + Pepper Squid (With fresh chilli and parsley, served with garlic mayo) & Beef Burnt Ends (Drizzled with homemade chimichurri). All were really nice, but the Asian Crispy Beef and Salt + Peeper Squid were sensational. We were off to a good start.
We had the 14oz Spiral Cut Angus Ribeye & Bar + Block House Salad with Salmon Fillet for our mains.
With a side of Onion Rings and a Baked Potato.
The Ribeye was absolutely fantastic, it melted in your mouth like butter, The triple cooked chips were really crispy and I loved them. The Chimichurri sauce was on point as well. The Onion rings were super crispy and melted in the mouth also. The salad and Salmon had the perfect balance of salad, dressing and avocado. Along with the Salmon and Baked Potato, was a major hit for my wife. We were full this time and had no room for a pudding. Another great meal at Bar + Block and it was a pleasant experience with Waheed. Looking forward to our next visit."
The Dhabba,5,"One of the best Indian food (authentic feel like in India üáÆüá≥)

Must visit even loved by the Scottish people ü•òüßÜ‚ù£Ô∏èüòª

Not too much spicy and tastes amazingly amazing triggers your taste buds and at moderate price. Best for team lunch, family gathering and friends.

If you want to have a taste of proper authentic Indian food then my suggestion would be to try this and I am sure the food and service will not disappoint you.

Thank you team ‚ÄúThe Dhabba‚Äù üëçüèªüëª"
The Dhabba,5,"A wonderful find in the heart of Glasgow! We had yellow daal, sabzi takatak and plain rice and I was pleasantly surprised by the authenticity of all the dishes. After a number of days of having mostly English food, this was a welcome change üòÉ the staff were polite and attentive."
The Dhabba,4,Quite amazing and authentic Indian food in the heart of Glasgow. Plenty of indoor seating available. The menu is quite extensive with amazing cuisines. Must try if in Glasgow.
The Dhabba,5,"The Dhabba is a highly-rated Indian restaurant in Glasgow, Scotland. It has been open since 2002 and has a loyal following of customers. The restaurant is known for its authentic North Indian cuisine, which is made with fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection.

The Dhabba's menu features a wide variety of dishes, including tandoori meats, curries, biryanis, and vegetarian options. The dishes are all cooked using traditional Indian methods, and the flavors are bold and complex. The restaurant also has a good selection of Indian beers and wines.

The Dhabba's interior is decorated in a traditional Indian style, with plenty of leafy plants and warm lighting. The atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming, and the staff are friendly and attentive.

The Dhabba is a great place to go for a special occasion or a casual meal with friends. The food is delicious, the service is excellent, and the atmosphere is good.

The Dhabba is a great place to go for Indian food in Glasgow. The food is delicious, the service is excellent, and the atmosphere is inviting. I highly recommend it."
The Dhabba,3,"All things considered, this place is just average and I would rather visit one of their competitors. I will say the food tastes pretty good and is presented well. It took a while for it to come out, about 45 minutes after ordering, which wasn't great. The prices are very high for what you get, especially given that some of the other Indian restaurants around Glasgow offer actually better food at reasonable prices. The waiting staff were nice, but overall service wasn't excellent. I liked the idea of the menu replicating the look of a newspaper, and the interior decore was nice.

I would just recommend you skip this place if you're craving an Indian and would rather visit one of their competitors in the southside or elsewhere in Glasgow."
Sylvan,4,"Good food, good service and a good location.

All vegetarian.  There were several very good dishes and my favorite was the cashews with seaweed salt.  Quite the combination."
Sylvan,3,"It‚Äôs okay and that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt really recommend taking the fried goat cheese and the roast pears together since both of the 2 dishes are of heavy rich texture and you will be quite full in the end. I feel I almost cannot take anything more in the end of fried goat cheese, and I don‚Äôt really want to eat the pears at all. Finally, I finished half of the roast pears.

Also, the dessert coconut rice pudding is a hot and creamy one, not giving me any refreshment but just strengthen the greasy feeling. It‚Äôs worth noting that their dessert white wine is great and gives me some fresh notes.

They put everything together, making it not a clear starter/main dishes/dessert, in that way I‚Äôm feeling I‚Äôm in a rush to finish everything..

The price is reasonable and staffs are helpful, but I think I will try other combinations since this time I wasn‚Äôt quite impressed by it. These dishes could be good if served as single dish, but the combination of them is not okay for me."
Sylvan,5,"Had such a lovely evening here, perfect for a date night and large groups as it is a tapas style restaurant. Didn't get any photos of the food because it was too good to not eat straight away. The menu is limited, but all options are vegetarian with many of vegan dishes also. As a meat-eater myself I was impressed that it didn't feel lacking. The staff are so attentive and friendly, they really added to the dining experience."
Sylvan,5,stunning. was in a group of 6 so we ordered almost everything on the menu and got to try it all and left very full. portions are well sized for the price. not a big drinker but the orange wine we had was lovely and it's definitely catered to people who like unique wine. will be back
Sylvan,4,Very nice experience at the place! The chicory salad with hazelnuts was unique and the vegan polenta came with lots of mushroom! Probably the mushroom was on the salty side but that was offset by the plain polenta. Definitely worth the try! I wish their babaganoush was vegan! Traditionally babaganoush does not need yoghurt in it!
Doppio Malto,3,"I went here for my friends birthday. It‚Äôs a very beautiful place and the decor is nice.

The food overall was ok. It‚Äôs not the best and it‚Äôs not the worst. I had chicken and chips basically and my chicken was not seasoned much and it was a bit hard to cut in. I would say it‚Äôs a bit overpriced. Service was ok as well."
Doppio Malto,3,"Think the food is of a particular taste or style so personal choice, but the wettest runniest risotto I have seen served before. Although they did take it off the bill and serve a cream traditional style cake along with dessert as an apology. Carbonara was very highly peppered as well so I also found that strange and overpowering which meant my son couldn't eat it.
So service would be 5/5 however ¬£90 for a sharing starter, 2 mains and 3 ice cream sundaes.. but then ¬£4 for a can of coke and ¬£4 for diet bru is utterly disgusting.. atmosphere was fab and staff lovely but scandalous pricing for less than average food."
Doppio Malto,4,Went here for a birthday meal and was so amazed by the quick service and lovely staff. Food was served within 10 minutes of ordering and tasted amazing. Ordered a portion of the Garlic Potato Wedges but wasn‚Äôt a fan so they took it off the bill! Cheesecake was delicious and the fries were top-notch. Will definitely be back here in the future. :)
Doppio Malto,4,"Amazing beer/beer cocktail! They really have good beer: you almost didn‚Äôt feel floating even if drinking much. Good atmosphere with some stuffs to play with your friends.

Burger is okay for me, really in a big portion and I cannot finish it all :) also feeling the beef is kind of salty and dry for me with too much red cabbage. Overall a good place to have a drink late night!"
Doppio Malto,2,"Previously a 5 star review, 2 years later the standards have slipped. Surroundings still lovely and staff still attentive, but the food isn‚Äôt the same and it‚Äôs certainly not better. The beer menu has been significantly cropped so it leaves a visit significantly less interesting than previously.  My bet is that it‚Äôs closed before the end of the year"
Cafe Andaluz,3,"We went for Valentine's Day dinner and this is our first time here. For a 3 course meal, we had bread and olives which was really good with a variety of bread offered. We ordered 5 tapas - out of which the prawns were the best. The baked aubergine and lamb were good too. The food was delicious with sangria. Finally, we had a brownie for dessert, so yummy but the sorbet was so bad that we couldn't have more than a bite."
Cafe Andaluz,5,"5 for lunch and 5* for lunch. Great choice and service. A real ""hidden gem"" in Cresswell Lane. Not enough room here to say how good the food was! I will definitely be coming back here, and anyone reading this review should try it."
Cafe Andaluz,5,"Everything was great! Whatever you order you‚Äôll know will be good, we did a bit of everything: Patatas Bravas, Croquetas de Jam√≥n y Queso, different chicken and lamb options, 10/10 ‚≠êÔ∏è The service was also great, the dishes came out quickly one after the other."
Cafe Andaluz,5,Went here with a friend a wee while ago and it was so good! I‚Äôve been to Cafe Andaluz in Edinburgh and this one is way better. The staff were amazing and attentive and the food was delicious. The decorations were really nice and it was nice and quiet when we went. I highly recommend going here if you‚Äôre looking for good Spanish food and tapas!!
Cafe Andaluz,4,Food was good and very well priced! Must say that I was a tiny bit disappointed by the paella but it was still good. Great service and atmosphere and the restaurant looks absolutely lovely.
La Lanterna West End,4,"The La Lanterna brand is held in lofty esteem in Glasgows culinary circles so I had high hopes in trying a fairly affordable lunch deal.

The restaurant itself is quite small and decorated with a simple Mediterranean charm. Bright and airy it feels intimate and upmarket. Location on Great Western Road is a nice compromise between Central and Byres Road.

The food was hearty and flavourful. Rich tomato, fresh and wholesome. At ¬£17.95 for two courses it was good value too.

However, if coming again I would opt for an evening meal as it just felt like it wasn‚Äôt in full flow and more going through the motions. The warm up if you will. Missing the X factor of a little buzz or exceptional service to elevate it to a full five star experience on this occasion. Quasi!!!"
La Lanterna West End,5,"I think this is my new favourite restaurant in Glasgow.  The food was outstanding. I had big juicy mussels, monkfish wrapped in ham with a fantastic tagliatelle sauce and a superb cannolli. Quality ingredients balanced perfectly.  If I was you I would book now."
La Lanterna West End,5,"Been here twice and both times were 10/10 for the food, service, atmosphere and just everything in general. Definitely my favourite restaurant to dine in the west end. Came today for my 21st birthday and the staff were lovely and very accommodating. The starter, main and dessert I had were total perfection and the drinks were great also, especially the strawberry margarita ü§©"
La Lanterna West End,5,"Another great meal, every single plate brought out was perfectly set and tasted fantastic. Can't wait to go back again. Staff very professional and lovely."
La Lanterna West End,5,"An excellent choice for a wonderful meal on a cold night. The pasta was easily one of the best meals of my trip to Glasgow, and was the perfect amount to eat. Staff was friendly but their reservation system is frustrating to navigate and it took me 4 tries to get a successful booking."
Eda Restaurant,4,"My friend and I visited here in Nov 2023 and it was good. The staff were very nice, friendly and the vibe was chill. We had some starters and mains and we were given complimentary bread as well. Although we asked for more bread but there was no mention that it required pay but I didn‚Äôt mind. At the end we had a dessert on the house which was lovely. Great place in general."
Eda Restaurant,5,"We visit this establishment time after time and never fails to disappoint
Extraordinary food
Amazing service with a smile - 1st class
Friendly team üòä
Humble chef and owner üôèüèº
Reasonably priced
Highly recommend"
Eda Restaurant,5,"I've eaten here a few times on my visits to Glasgow. I can safely say that they make the best lamb doner ever! The aubergine lamb is excellent as well and so is the mixed grill. The starters are ok. The Turkish tea is superb!
It's nice to see that the manager patiently trains the young students who serve here part-time. They are very polite and despite the high pressure during busy times, they learn to manage the floor with grace."
Eda Restaurant,5,"We had a delicious dinner at Eda, everything was flavourful and the portions were generous. We also had complimentary starters and salad which was a lovely touch and much appreciated! The service was great as well and as a vegetarian I liked that they had many options to choose from.  I will definitely go back."
Eda Restaurant,5,"Fantastic food today. 3 of use shared hot mixed meze along with lamb chops, lamb meatballs and chicken wings with rice and salad. Really friendly staff and good atmosphere. My wife thoroughly enjoyed the Turkish white wine. Will definitely be back"
The Left Bank,5,"I‚Äôm still thinking about this place!! Great breakfast and lunch options here. The gochujang chicken sandwich was incredible (although as someone who loves sauce, I wish it had a little more sauce/gochujang on it). The crispy edges were the best part! But that‚Äôs not all, you get a side of their delectable rosemary fries and a side salad. I normally don‚Äôt go crazy for side salads, but I don‚Äôt know what they put in there to make me polish off every last bit. Plus, portion sizes were very generous. Seems to be a great place to grab drinks as well, as I watched cocktails being distributed to tables. Dog friendly!!"
The Left Bank,5,"Fantastic experience! Delectable food and super reasonable prices. Our waiter was kind, patient, and lovely to chat with. The food came out quickly and we loved everything. I would absolutely recommend the eggs with smoked salmon and one of the refreshing seltzers. If I'm ever in Glasgow again, I'll make sure to stop by this place for some delicious food and great people."
The Left Bank,5,"This place never lets you down. Welcoming staff, wide selection of  menus - and including vegetarian and separate vegan menus - and they accept dogs!
This time I had the vegetarian Indian Pole Bowl. So delicious, freshest of ingredients and super filling. Happy ‚≠êÔ∏èHappy ‚≠êÔ∏è Happy‚≠êÔ∏è"
The Left Bank,5,"This is an absolutely spot-on place for atmosphere, service & food.  It's not cheap but definitely NOT overpriced for the quality, taste and service of food.
I went with the chef's soup of the day (coconut & tumeric) accompanied with toasted sourdough bread and astoundingly salubrious and flavoursome olives - fresh water is served at every table.
Staff are lovely and genuinely helpful.
Will return! üíñ"
The Left Bank,4,Went for breakfast today and we weren‚Äôt disappointed! The staff were welcoming and genuinely friendly. There was a good vibe in the restaurant/cafe. Great coffee too! A wee bit pricey however I would say that based on what we ate it was worth it and we can‚Äôt wait to come back again!
Curlers Rest Glasgow,5,Absolutely fabulous place. I booked the upstairs function room for my 30th and it was perfect. The staff were great and allowed us to put up decorations. The preordered food was delicious and came out on time. We had a great time! Thanks so much!
Curlers Rest Glasgow,2,"I love it here for drinks, but we got food today and what a rip off! ¬£13 for a pitiful mac & cheese and stale garlic bread, said to the staff they‚Äôre like yeah that‚Äôs how it is. Oran Mor up the street charging less for mac & cheese, least you get  an adult sized portion that fills you up. Won‚Äôt be eating here again."
Curlers Rest Glasgow,5,"Went in for some food and had an unbelievable experience! The food was amazing, the customer service was fantastic. Big shout out to Brad for the service he gave us today! He was nothing short of amazing with us and answered all of our questions! It‚Äôs hard to find service of this level but Brad and his team went above and beyond. Will definitely be back"
Curlers Rest Glasgow,2,"The burgers were good. The chicken roast was very poor, I could not cut the stuffing it was so hard, there were no roast potatoes and the veg were cold and hard. The pastry on the pie was burnt and the filling dry and minimal. Nobody came to check on us at all and no plates or glasses were cleared in the 90 minutes we were there.  The table had not been cleaned when we were shown to it."
Curlers Rest Glasgow,5,"Nice pub with good food and board games!
It is absolutely huge inside, lots of seatings and good food!
The crofter‚Äôs pie was delicious, my friends enjoyed their steak pie and burgers as well. The sticky toffee pudding is great, the pulled pork chips are tasty. They have a good selections of drinks too.
The best part is that they have quite a few board games to choose from so you can enjoy food as well as games with your friends! Nice service as well !"
One Restaurant,5,"Very delicious food and drinks. Quick, modern, and friendly and helpful staff."
One Restaurant,5,"Had afternoon tea today with 3 friends. Food was lovely both choice and amount. Our server Grace  was so attentive and nothing was a bother too her, lovely girl. Setting spacious and very clean. We have been before for afternoon tea and would recommend to anyone for lovely time."
One Restaurant,2,The food was lovely but the service was bad. Had to go and ask for our orders to be taken then again a half hour later to ask where the meal was. When it finally arrived it was delicious but we were too hurried then to really enjoy it.
One Restaurant,5,God food god servive nice and friendly staff. Sorry for my bad England
One Restaurant,3,The food was nice enough but the staff were not very well informed about the food and drink on offer so we're not very helpful when it came to answering questions.
Mini Grill Steakhouse - Glasgow,4,"Nice atmosphere and lovely food! I enjoyed the fillet steak, very nicely cooked, although was more impressed by my partner's dish of choice which was a Trio of Lamb, truly beautiful dish and delicious. Staff were friendly and attentive. The chips that came with the steak were amazing! It's a small but cosy restaurant, I like that the place is central but in a quieter location on Bath Street."
Mini Grill Steakhouse - Glasgow,5,We visited here to celebrate my wife‚Äôs birthday and this place did not disappoint. Both Trisha and Emma greeted us with such a lovely warm welcome and looked after us just perfectly. The food is absolutely amazing. We are not going to wait for a birthday until we go back. Love this place.
Mini Grill Steakhouse - Glasgow,5,Was given a voucher as a gift and I would definitely come back. The food and service was amazing. Would definitely recommend the Mini Grill Steakhouse
Mini Grill Steakhouse - Glasgow,5,"Absolutely loved it. My new favourite restaurant.
I had food envy before I'd even ordered because the menu is so good and I knew I'd miss out on something.
Haggis trio was some of the best haggis I've had. I begrudgingly went for lamb (instead of steak, in a steak place, I know), and that shepherd's pie is genuinely the nicest mouthful of food I've ever eaten.
Staff were excellent. Nice atmosphere, cosy but not too crowded. Good wine. A little pricey, but worth it!"
Mini Grill Steakhouse - Glasgow,5,"Incredible food, incredible service and just an amazing place to eat! The staff are so friendly and make you feel welcome and possibly the best food I have eaten."
Las Iguanas - Glasgow,5,"Monica was lovely. This was our first meal out since getting married and she was super friendly. Service was very quick and she was very attentive, always checking on us for drinks and making sure our food was good. We are very happy! And can't wait to return. Thank you! She even gave us a glass of prosecco to congratulate us which I thought was a lovely touch."
Las Iguanas - Glasgow,5,"Very big space with an impressive variety. Love the fact that they put calories on the menus. And if you check the online menu you can even find the macros for the dishes. So rare! So useful!

Had üêî fajitas that were very tasty and fresh."
Las Iguanas - Glasgow,4,"We went on a Tuesday night, so it wasn't busy, but they do have a ton of seating. The atmosphere was amazing, and so did the interior. The wait on drinks and food wasn't too long. Food wise, I think it's a little overpriced for the quality and amount, but it's still good. The cocktails, though, are delicious. I definitely recommend the mango collins. The staff was also very polite"
Las Iguanas - Glasgow,5,"Food was absolutely delicious, we ordered 6 tapas dishes to share and every single one was amazing. Would definitely be back. We also turned up half an hour early on the off chance we could be seated early and they managed to squeeze us in. Staff all lovely and helpful."
Las Iguanas - Glasgow,5,Really like it here. A regular customer mainly because the vegan and plant based options are great. Recently were booked in for a boozy brunch and the food and cocktails were great - really good selection and also with the option to upgrade to a main from the main menu. Staff were really friendly and always attentive meaning we got our 5 drinks pp in a good time. Definitely will be back for this. Most of our party  ordered the non-vegan options that I haven't had before and also said the food is great!
Roastit Bubbly Jocks,5,"Unassuming and brilliant restaurant. It's a great place to try some Scottish classic dishes like haggis, neeps and tatties or a creamy smoked haddock chowder. The salad with whipped Goat's cheese was delightful. Fabulous food and very friendly service!"
Roastit Bubbly Jocks,5,"Food is fantastic, the menu has a great variety of dishes for everyone, the portions are generous and all reasonably priced.
Been here several times and never disappointed. Staff go above and beyond to ensure customers are happy. Special thanks to Frank & Sean, who were absolute STARS from start to finish helping us celebrate a 70th birthday meal this weekend. Cannot recommend this place enough, ideal place for a light brunch, dinner or a special occasion. 10/10!!! Thanks again."
Roastit Bubbly Jocks,5,"Came for breakfast with the wife and my parents. First time. Great wee find this. The staff are really friendly and the food is top class. My mum had blueberry pancakes and the rest of us had Scottish cooked breakfasts. By far the best breakfast I‚Äôve had in Scotland, never mind Glasgow. Been full all day. Back to London now for drab Full English. Shame. I‚Äôll be back"
Roastit Bubbly Jocks,5,"One of the best breakfasts I‚Äôve ever had, lovely staff, definitely recommend! Also really well priced for such good quality food!"
Roastit Bubbly Jocks,5,"Cant rate Roastit Bubbly Jocks high enough,  Frank and his team provide a great experience in real good food dining. Service, value for money, a unique and warm intimate venue atmosphere, he treats his customers like friends. Thank you, always a  favourite of ours. üëç"
Revoluci√≥n de Cuba Glasgow,5,"An anniversary gift from my sister , we really enjoyed our ‚ÄòCuban Afternoon Tea for Two‚Äô , a delightful selection of savoury and sweet tapas, and a cocktail each. I ordered the vegetarian selection for myself and was pleasantly surprised. Portions were good size and the desserts were delicious, churros were spot on mmmm‚Ä¶! The staff were great and very attentive. Nice decor, big and airy venue, would definitely recommend‚ù§Ô∏è"
Revoluci√≥n de Cuba Glasgow,5,"Visited for a work function, 18 of us, so a big crowd.
The staff were excellent, the place itself wasn't too busy which hopefully helped, but we had our food on time, which was delicious (I opted for the steak, of course). Drinks were brought out timely and we didn't have to wait at all.

The food was part of a set menu, so they knew knew in advance the order, but it was all still well cooked, tasty and barely a wait, all brought out at a reasonable time. Once all finished, we stayed for a few more drinks.

The smoking area outside was.. Interesting, met some colourful people (backs onto a car park), but this didn't matter. I have to stop smoking anyway!"
Revoluci√≥n de Cuba Glasgow,4,"We had a tough time getting a table at other places for a party of 6 but managed to get one in here on spec tonight. Food was excellent and the service was friendly. They forgot one of the starters, and mixed the burgers up at the table, thankfully the person hadn't started eating so that was ok but full marks can't be given."
Revoluci√≥n de Cuba Glasgow,4,Empanadas and croquettes were amazing. And defo go for the plantain tacos. Tapas great for sharing.
Revoluci√≥n de Cuba Glasgow,2,"Where to start‚Ä¶ had a look at the reviews for this place and they weren‚Äôt great by a long shot. Kept seeing reviews saying the staff aren‚Äôt great at all. We decided to give it a go anyway, our waitress was amazing (wish I remembered her name) we might of just been very lucky. With regards to food and drinks. My wife order a mojito and it was awful, was nothing like a mojito. In saying that all our other cocktails were very pleasant. The food was a major let down so if it isn‚Äôt right and you won‚Äôt send it back then don‚Äôt bother coming here. Both myself and my wife had to return our meals. I ordered the chicken burger, it was so overcooked and dry it was like sawdust no joke. My wife ordered the quesadillas and they were burnt black. The replacements were day and night. It‚Äôs a shame because if the food wasn‚Äôt awful the first time round then this place would of been really good.  Nice atmosphere and vibe especially with the live music."
The Calabash African Bar and Restaurant,3,"After a long day of exploring Glasgow, I needed an African touch and The Calabash African Bar and Restaurant was recommended. Had mama's special and it was not that bad. Had African Fanta as well. It was noisy from music and other guests though. But good location in the city centre."
The Calabash African Bar and Restaurant,4,"I had a lovely experience at this restaurant, located in Glasgow. I was hungry and wanted to eat my Nigerian delicacy. It was quite easy to locate by Google map. The restaurant itself looks good and neat with enough eating tables for customers, I rocked and enjoyed the afro music playing in the background, it gave me a feeling of home. Their menu contains variety of African - Nigerian food s, drinks and snacks. I ordered the infamous palm wine which I have missed for over 5yrs. The cost of food was OK, quite affordable. Good customer service, but they need to employ more staff to make the service quicker, I had to wait for about 30 minutes to get my meal. Also, the chicken I ate didn't taste like a hard chicken from Africa. The vegetable soup I ate was very delicious, but a bit watery. The pounded yam was perfect!!.
In conclusion, I didn't regret coming there, and hope to come back anytime I am in Glasgow."
The Calabash African Bar and Restaurant,5,The food here is AMAZING! I always get the  nyama choma (sizzling lamb) and the chikina awaze tibis (lamb with the delicious spongy injera). Bala is the best! We live in Edinburgh but he remembers us (and what we eat) every time!
The Calabash African Bar and Restaurant,4,Good food and night Africa home environment. Really feel no e to see other people of kind. Very nice place to meet friends. They have a variety of African and Caribbean foods selections.
The Calabash African Bar and Restaurant,5,"Wonderful for African dishes. Nyama choma and ugali is the best in Scotland, Githeri is also available."
The Loveable Rogue,5,"Lovely visit this evening to experience their taster menu. Warm welcome from the staff who looked after us very well throughout, all with a smile and cheery banter. The food and drinks arrived promptly. The menu demonstrated a great range of dishes with a lovely variety of flavours and textures. All were delicious! Looking forward to returning to sample their menu again."
The Loveable Rogue,5,"This was our first visit, despite it being a Thursday it was busy, maybe because it was the day after Valentine‚Äôs. The food was excellent, see photos. The mushroom/brisket/cheese sauce park of the dish was to die for. The Gluten free batter was very tasty. We will go again"
The Loveable Rogue,5,Fantastic meal and the vibe of the restaurant was great. We went for the Sunday roast deal which is such good value for money. Absolutely loved the food especially all the sides and how they were presented. Will definitely be back!
The Loveable Rogue,3,"The food was lovely couldn't fault it, Value for money excellent. However service was poor adjacent tables received lots of attention, Our table didn't. This really tarnished the evening as we enjoy interactions with staff."
The Loveable Rogue,5,"We visited The Loveable Rogue on a Thursday lunchtime, the place was not busy when we arrived but more people came when we were eating. It's a nice atmosphere, a lot of light but cosy, we sat in one of the booths.
We were welcome by Alex, a friendly member of the staff that talked us through the highlights of the menu for the day and suggested the right cocktails to go with the food, providing the explanation for his reasoning.
We went for crunchy oysters, Scotch eggs, white bait, lamb and potatoes with black pudding and cheese board.
I have to say that last time I had such a great food was at Michelin star grade establishment. The flavours and the textures were perfectly balanced and the attention to the presentation of the plates was clear too. Everything was enhanced by the fantastic drinks that everything was paired with. The bill came at about 60 pound each including a good tip, which I thought it was good value considering the amount and quality of the food, plus the couple of cocktails each. It's a great place and we will definitely go back."
Ardnamurchan Scottish Restaurant & Bar,5,"This is hands down a must try when in Glasgow! This was one of the top two meals I‚Äôve ever had in my life, tying with a Florentine steak in Florence. We had the Stormoway black pudding fritters and fried goat cheese appetizers. 10/10 on both. My husband had the venison stew (10/10)  and I had the venison pave (50/10)! The venison was EXCEPTIONAL and is from their estate. We had the crumble (8/10) and sticky toffee pudding (20/10) for dessert. Don‚Äôt miss out on their hour whisky. The rum cask was one I wish I‚Äôd found earlier in our trip so we could have purchased a bottle to take  home- such a unique. The atmosphere was lovely and the staff was very helpful and lovely. Also for all that the price was a bargain. I‚Äôm shocked it wasn‚Äôt double the price for this quality. You MUST eat here!!"
Ardnamurchan Scottish Restaurant & Bar,5,One of the best restaurants we've visited! Spacious restaurant with friendly staff and fast service! The food was delicious and presented beautifully! The staff member who greeted us at the start even stopped by to ask whether they need to call us a taxi to the airport after we finished our meal. Super thoughtful and attentive. Thank you!
Ardnamurchan Scottish Restaurant & Bar,5,"Haggis, neeps, and tatties were delicious. Well seasoned with silky flavourful gravy. My partner had the potato cheese gratin which was also well made and savory.
The drinks were well crafted as well, and did not disappoint.
Our server was very kind and helpful in menu selection, and regularly checked in on us throughout dinner.
I really liked it here, I would go again to experience more well made Scottish food."
Ardnamurchan Scottish Restaurant & Bar,4,"If you are looking for authentic, hearty, well plated Scottish food look no further. It‚Äôs a showcase of local produce in an upscale and well dressed dining area.

Portions and menu can‚Äôt be faulted on this visit but the service felt a bit underwhelming for a special occasion but Im willing to bet that might just be a post Xmas hangover and an off night.

It‚Äôs maybe more formal than some other eateries but it hits all the right notes in culinary craft. A thoroughly satisfactory spot to impress your friends or visitors."
Ardnamurchan Scottish Restaurant & Bar,5,"Food was incredible - one of the best meals I‚Äôve had in a long time. Cullen skink was out of this world, seafood stew and mussels all fantastic. And a very nice touch - they had Faragaia on the menu - the nice non-alcoholic spirit made in Scotland that was similar to a floral St. Germain. The service was also fantastic - prices were reasonable - I highly recommend Ardnamurchan for upscale Scottish food - we will definitely be back!"
Gamba,5,"The fish soup (crab meat with ginger and coriander) is amazing. Crispy fried stone bass tastes well, especially with the lettuce salad.
The warm sticky toffee pudding tastes too sweat, not recommended."
Gamba,5,"Been coming here for years.  One of my favourite restaurants. If you enjoy fish dishes this place is great, lots of delicious choices. The service is really good, very nice ambience, really enjoyed their fish soup with prawn balls."
Gamba,3,"The chef and I must have different tastes. My main course, Halibut in Cullen Skink sauce, came with a substantial amount of smoked haddock. It had a powerful flavour. I would have enjoyed Halibut much more if there wasn't smoked haddock at all. Panna cotta wasn't appetizing either. We had a great seafood dinner elsewhere in the city centre for a much lower price so our expectations were not met."
Gamba,5,The food here is top class as is the service. It was very busy and it‚Äôs not cheap. Can‚Äôt wait to return.
Gamba,5,This excellent restaurant has been in business since 1998. It is not cheap but the quality of he experience shows why it has survived for this length of time when most others have not. It is not a great place if you don't like seafood because the choices for you will be limited. The wine menu is not extensive but there is plenty of variety and the description of the white wine we chose was accurate. It went extremely well with our food. We will definitely return.
Glaschu Restaurant & Bar,2,"Have to say, slightly disappointed! This was a birthday present for me bought by my friends. Service was good, very attentive. Appetisers were probably the best thing about the meal, sourdough bread with chicken butter was lovely, as was the salmon cornet. I had roast of the day, the chicken was dry, Yorkshire pudding was rock hard and inedible. Desert of lime and coconut was just not nice at all. Far too sweet. Really wish I had not ordered that! My husband has beef which was very tough. All in all, I was very disappointed.  I had high expectations due to the reputation, but unfortunately, I would not return as this experience put me right off. Prices are far too high to have poor food! Vibes seem to be very posh, but the food needs to keep up with this or people will not return. Real shame!"
Glaschu Restaurant & Bar,5,"Sunday was an absolute delight with my partner! The experience was beyond wonderful. The waiter was very accommodating, a friendly and warm demeanor. The restaurant's ambiance struck the perfect balance between classy sophistication and a laid-back, relaxing vibe. Food and drinks - they were simply amazing, I wholeheartedly recommend this place with a resounding 100% and can't wait to return!"
Glaschu Restaurant & Bar,5,"Everything from the food to the service was fantastic!
It was hard for us outsiders to find,  but google maps finally got us there.  It was simply amazing spot to enjoy our 28th Anniversary dinner while in Glasgow"
Glaschu Restaurant & Bar,3,"A very nice restaurant with brilliant service from staff. The food was quite nice but I wouldn't really say amazing. Being blunt, it doesn't warrant the prices they charge. I've been to restaurants with more flavourful dishes for much less. Not sure I'd be going back here in future in all honesty."
Glaschu Restaurant & Bar,5,"Location on the first floor of the western club Glasgow.

beautiful interior, low lighting and patterned carpet to the first floor.

The restaurant design is chic, modern.

Good value 2/3 course meal with a discount if member of the western club.

The heritage tomato with goat cheese on puff pastry was excellent.

The coley with clams and sauce was also excellent. Coley was crispy on the outside and just done on the inside. Nice greens too.

Pinot noir was good.

Service attentive."
Sugo Pasta,5,"Used to love sugo pasta, however a recent change in menu has removed pasta number 8 which was, to me, the best. No other pasta to me tastes that amazing that I'd wait the times you need to for a seat.

When sitting food comes rapidly however when waiting to be seated it can be a while, and while waiting for the bill can be even longer.

Sugo is good for a quick bite to eat and wouldn't recommend for anything intimate as the restaurant is very loud and busy."
Sugo Pasta,5,Sugo Pasta is excellent! It was recommended by a friend and I‚Äôm so happy to have gone. There are great pasta selections and each are made fresh daily. We loved our dishes! We arrived just before noon on a Saturday and were seated quickly but there was a very long queue when we left! The restaurant is large so I think it moved quickly and is absolutely worth the wait! Great prices and great service as well. Will definitely be back!
Sugo Pasta,5,"Best pasta in town. Glad to had tried Sugo during our short 2 days trip here in Glasgow.

Lots of table and the atmosphere is buzzing, but do expect a bit of wait for seats during dinner hour. Service was good."
Sugo Pasta,5,"What an amazing place for freshly cooked pasta and great wine. You can't book, need to turn up, give your name and wait. We went to the pub opposite and came back 40 minutes later and straight in to sit down.
Pasta is freshly cooked and the beef Ragu was super tasty.
It was a Tuesday and the place was rammed. Very fast service and all reasonably priced."
Sugo Pasta,5,"Great place for pasta in Glasgow! Serves a wide variety of pasta where most of them are scrumptious and good portion size for its money.

Loved the linguine in a Puttanesca sauce with Fresh Mackerel. Tastes very savoury with tiny bit of fishy taste for more layers of tastefulness. Not sure if it's available very day as it is from the special menu. The pasta with ragu beef was great too, beef is tender and the sauce is flavourful. Definitely try their tiramisu for dessert, one of the best I've had! Wines are also served here.

Definitely returning when visiting Glasgow next time."
Joia Italian Restaurant and Bar,5,"A lovely Italian restaurant in the heart of Finnieston. The menu is full of delicious dishes, making it difficult to choose from, as you simply want everything. It changes seasonally, so there is always something exciting to look forward to. The staff was attentive and friendly. Thanks!"
Joia Italian Restaurant and Bar,5,"Beautiful seafood cooked to perfection. Staff are delightful, very friendly and helpful. Polenta starter could have used a little salad maybe. Just being picky though. Will return very soon. Highly recommend."
Joia Italian Restaurant and Bar,5,A picturesque setting for a nice dinner. The staff is very friendly and hospitable. Their desserts are to die for. My favorite is their pistachio lava cake! Definitely recommend a visit.
Joia Italian Restaurant and Bar,5,"This restaurant is definitely worth a visit, our waitress was incredibly friendly and personable. The food was a 10 out of 10 so really delicious and the ambience invites you to relax."
Joia Italian Restaurant and Bar,4,"I won‚Äôt recommend it. The pasta I ordered was too chewy and salty ( I know it‚Äôs proper Italian way of cooking but it‚Äôs under cook to my tastes). The lasagne was ok. All in all, I won‚Äôt recommend it to a friend and I won‚Äôt go back."
Mother India Restaurant,4,"I recently dined at Mother India Restaurant and I must say, my overall experience was fantastic. The food was absolutely delicious, with every bite bursting with flavor. The ambience of the restaurant was also wonderful, creating the perfect atmosphere for a pleasant meal. While the service was not top-notch, as I was initially charged for an item I did not order, the staff was quick to rectify the issue and make things right. I highly recommend trying the vegetarian thali, which was not only perfect in taste but also more than enough for two people. And to top it all off, the gulab jamun dessert was the perfect ending to an already amazing meal. Mother India Restaurant is definitely a must-visit for all food lovers!"
Mother India Restaurant,5,Had a lovely meal here before attending a show at the hydro. The food was delicious and the service was very efficient. My only slight criticism is that staff are a little overbearing as we were asked 3 times in the space of a minute if we were enjoying our meal which I find quite off putting. I would definitely visit again though. I would recommend booking in advance as it is small restaurant and filled up pretty quickly.
Mother India Restaurant,5,Fabulous dining room we were seated downstairs. Best Indian food I've ever had. Fish pakora was fresh and light followed by sea bass with chickpea and potato. Staff friendly and efficient. Highly recommend.
Mother India Restaurant,1,Much anticipated but sadly the food was terrible.  I have had better Chicken tikka masalas from a Tesco ready meal than whatever this was supposed to be.  The pilau rice was tasteless at best.   When we rang them to complain they just told us to take it up with Uber.  Of course yes silly me I forgot the Uber drivers make the food.  Folks don't believe the hype about this place plenty of other Indian food restaurants out there.
Mother India Restaurant,5,"We were here before the pandemic, and from what I've heard it is your mainly saying.
When I asked manager about one of my favorite Indian dishes, they were able to accommodate me, even though it wasn't on the menu.

I really recommend this place. The atmosphere, the food, the service we're all outstanding

When we visit Glasgow again in the near future, we will be dining here with friends we're bringing with us."
Roma Mediterranean Restaurant,4,"Been here quite a few times.

The girls got carbonara and dessert.

I prefer a mix of starters and a side (mushrooms in a white sauce and mussels in a white sauce which comes with garlic bread).  I also got a side of chips, I keep forgetting to tell them no salt, they always come heavily salted to the point I end up not eating them but my friend did.

We got soft drinks x1 each."
Roma Mediterranean Restaurant,2,Beware of expensive add ons!! The portions are decently sized but the food is so extremely bland. I had the chicken carbonara and the chicken tasted old and chewy. The carbonara had no taste at all and I had to heavily salt it to make it edible. The pollo al Pepe and the steak were so average for the prices we were paying. The garlic bread also had no taste whatsoever. The cocktails were delicious but often the food would come before the drinks. However the staff were nice and the atmosphere was cute. Such bad value for money as the prices were absolutely extortionate!!
Roma Mediterranean Restaurant,5,"Wanted a quick bite to eat pre-show.  This place had great deals on 2 and 3 courses.  Food was quickly received and was lovely.  The restaurant has beautiful decor.  Food is very reasonably priced and good sized portions.  However what is a reasonably priced meal becomes less so when drinks and service charge are added on.  Over ¬£6 for a Peroni is expensive, especially compared to wetherspoons the evening before."
Roma Mediterranean Restaurant,3,"The place was good, service was amazing, we ordered pizza and garlic bread. but the pizza crust was overcooked. The garlic bread was lacking flavours."
Roma Mediterranean Restaurant,3,Lack of communication and hustled out quite quickly.  Ordered peroni and got water!!.  Didn't have the cheesecake they had advised me of so they just gave me something else without asking. Constantly at the table asking if it was OK which was annoying.  Cleared the table really quickly which gave me the impression they didn't want us to stay too long. Food was OK and pleasant atmosphere.
Red Onion,5,"Been meaning to eat here for several years, having tried the food at a BBC Good Food exhibition. My wife's lactose intolerance was a non-issue. We had the pre-theatre fixed price menu (she had the dairy-free version, including a banana fritter). Loads of choice, delicious food, and the service was terrific. The chef even dropped by our table to say hello. Next time we are visiting Glasgow we will definitely be back"
Red Onion,4,"A very cute place. They closed their full menu earlier than their hours indicated. We were able to order from apps and salads. The food was pretty good. It was all cooked well and served prettily. Bathrooms were clean. Service was minimal and mostly forgot us. I couldn't make eye contact with a server to save my life, so it was a pretty thirsty meal for me. Mostly just enjoyed the ambiance. I'd head somewhere else if I was choosing again."
Red Onion,5,Beautiful restaurant. The food is absolutely delicious and it's a lovely atmosphere. Really great service even when busy.
Red Onion,5,"Food superb, one of the best gluten free / coeliac friendly menu options I seen
Staff were lovely &friendly and very attentive but not over bearing so
We would  definitely revisit next time we are in Glasgow"
Red Onion,5,"The atmosphere was very chill and very friendly staff.
We had duck and sunday roast! Which was very good, the scallops as well."
