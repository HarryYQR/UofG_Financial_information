"We enjoyed an excellent Sunday roast in the lovely restaurant in Bath street Glasgow- the team are really nice, there is no rush and not only is the food really good it‚Äôs presented very well- next time in Glasgow we plan to return during the week for a Steak!"
"A small, cosy central place located in the city centre of Glasgow on Bath street. The decor provided a homely feel, with a Scottish touch and the staff all went above and beyond.

Starters: 
Haggis trio: 7.5
Bruschetta: 7.4

Mains overall: 9.3
Sharing chataurbriand steak with sides of
Macaroni cheese and Chicken and Parmesan fries

Cocktails were outstanding too!"
"Was absolutely lovely visiting here on our holiday, Sam was so polite! The wine was lovely and the steak wow! Best I‚Äôve had"
Absolutely fabulous meal! Do it! The lobster was big and buttery delicious. It was a wonderful experience! 
"Its not cheap to eat here but you will not leave hungry!  It is well worth it! You pay for your lobster at the entrance so decide how hungry you are before you sit down!  I chose a 1 pounder and my husband chose 1 1/2 pounds. It was totally enough.  You are offered seconds on everything except for the lobster. Started with bread and butter. Choice of soup or chowder.  I had the soup of the day which was excellent and my husband chose the chowder which he loved.  Then buckets of mussels.  Next course was 3 different salads - small portions but totally adequate.  The lobster is all cut up for you for ease of eating. They supply bibs and all the tools for getting all the meat out.  The desserts were delicious. I chose the mile high lemon meringue pie and my husband took the coconut cream.  Yummy.  Tea, coffee and soft drinks included.  It was so crowded as lots of bus tours come in but it was fun and there's tons of room for everyone.  The service was excellent and was super friendly.  Would highly recommend eating here."
"This is a must go spot in PEI.  Make the drive and enjoy the experience.  Bring a serious appetite and they will squash it like a bug.  This is a new favorite spot for us when visiting the island.  When asked for seconds, just say ""yes"" and get after it! Enjoy!"
"We have always thoroughly enjoyed our experience here when visiting PEI. It is efficient, pleasant and clean, and with warm and friendly service. It is very reasonably priced. A must!"
"We have had a  very full and sumptuous dinner at the New Glasgow Lobster Suppers. Unlimited buckets of fresh mussels were provided as appetiser. I was half full after eating more than 10 mussels. The lobster meats was slightly tough probably from overlooking. However, I still enjoyed it. The Atlantic Salmon that my husband had was very tender and juicy üòãüëç!! I had to skip the desert."
"This is a must place to visit
Looks nothing from the road , but a warm welcome awaits...grab your drink and go to the terraces, and the roof terrace, you will not be disappointed ( will not ruin but the view sells this place) 
Sa hi to the parrots for me and put your feet up and chill Tobagan style"
"For anyone traveling to Tobago, this is a must stop on a sight seeking tour. Not only because of the amazing photos that one will take home, but it's the perfect place to sit, have a cold beer, and feel the stress leave you. "
What a view from this lovely rustic bar.  Friendly owner and the mUsic was great too.  Good stop off to enjoy a cold drink and take in the views.
"I saw Glasgow‚Äôs bar as I turned a winding corner en route from Castara to Charlotteville.  Needless to say, I made note of the bar straight away, for the return trip later on during my holiday.  The location of the bar was clearly worth a stop, and I‚Äôm glad we did.

Glasgow‚Äôs Bar is perched on the crest of a steep slope overlooking Parlatuvier Bay.  Mr Kurt Glasgow has the perfect establishment for an afternoon beverage on a humid Caribbean day.  The bar balcony overlooks the bay and captures the breeze coming off the ocean.  The concreted balcony has plenty of spots to relax with your drink, protected from any tropical storms!

I had a strong rum, my girlfriend had a carib beer.  Then we had another.  The staff were friendly and it was hard not to want to just stay all day and watch the tides come in and out.

Attached to the bar is a takeaway restaurant ‚ÄúParadise Point Finger Licking‚Äù and the name says it all.  We ordered stewed fish and dumplings, and ate our meals on the table next to the restaurant in the sun.  Whatever you chose to eat, ensure that you get dumplings!

Our drinks came to TTD$38 and our food was TTD$83.  If we didn‚Äôt have plans afterwards, we probably would have stayed for the afternoon, simply watching the world go by."
"We took a walk from Castara to Parlatuvier and here we stoped for a cold drink and to look over the view and down to the beach we were heading. Perfect for that, drink break with view! "
Another visit to our favourite restaurant. Menu has changed since our last visit but staff accommodated and let us order items no longer on the menu.‚Äôcan never fault the food or the staff always a pleasure and look forward to our next dinner there.
Wonderful experience. The food was excellent as was the service. If you like pate give it a try. Start to finish it was great!
"Visited the restaurant on Wednesday night with 3 friends.  The food was excellent and would highly recommend it.  Just after the coffees arrive one of our party became seriously unwell,  the staff were very quick to react and attentive and make sure an ambulance was called.  Stuart the front of house manage and his team very excellent and looked after us with care and compassion while we waited on the ambulance.  Outstanding food and service and definitely worth a visit."
My Husband and I had another amazing meal here tonight. Good and staff are first class. Just everything is perfect. Look forward to our next visit
Another visit to our favourite restaurant in Glasgow. A beautiful restaurant and of course the food is excellent üòã we might only visit once a year but we look forward to our fab meal üòä
"Been to Ka Pao a few times but not for at least 18 months maybe longer. We booked for the Glasgow restaurant week set menu with great anticipation and loved every dish. Everything was so full of labour, fresh and great portions. Delicious. Service was great. Tried a cocktail which also got top marks. Can't fault a thing. Will hopefully be back soon 10/10"
"I was in the area and searching on trip advisor this restaurant popped up. It happened to be Glasgow restaurant week and they had a special menu with 5 different plates plus dessert for 25 pounds so I chose it. 
I liked all the plates I had, except the salad, it had too much mint for my taste. The service was fast and efficient, the atmosphere very nice, big space and naturally lighted despite the fact that it's at a low floor.
I would return anytime"
"Need to book in advance to guarantee a table. The food amazing! So fresh and flavoursome, good value for money. I am not vegetarian but the vegetarian dishes steal the show, so creative."
"Really nice room, sultry lighting, open kitchen. Gorgeous corn, chicken and peppers, the portions were generous so they actually let us cancel our pork special as we were full! I asked if they could use it for the next order and it wasn‚Äôt a problem at all. Yum from start to finish!"
"Nice place, very different dinning experience, strange combination of foods some of which worked and some didn‚Äôt, decor was nice but a little dark, very busy."
"The delivery team were friendly. However, I ordered multiple items and one of them was not delivered. I was not emailed to make me aware of this. I paid ¬£25 for my items to be delivered today, and this was not carried out. It wasn‚Äôt delivered due to it being out of stock. This is not the delivery teams fault, it is ikeas. I am extremely disappointed and dissatisfied."
Really good value but the children‚Äôs macaroni cheese is too salty for my 3 year old.   It needs a lot less seasoning     The other meals were good with no complaints
Absolutely awful breakfast. Cold and congealed. Cold Grey sausages. Cold Bacon swimming in watery fat. Every item on the plate was horrible. To add insult to injury the coffee station was filthy and the beverages tepid. Milk dispenser was broken so had to use the slightly warm carton of milk which had been supplied. . Had same experience last time I used the restaurant..don‚Äôt know why I gave it another go but certainly won‚Äôt make the same mistake again. Really poor IKEA.
"The lady who sits on the till in the restaurant in the Glasgow IKEA who is called Jacqui needs to be removed from any customer facing duties as her attitude is appalling, her customer skill levels are shocking and she acts as if she is doing you a favour. She does not want to help anyone and when you ask her something she makes you feel as if you have no right to ask any questions and that you are annoying her . 

This has happened every time we visit when Jacqui is on the till."
"Despite advertising an assortment of breakfast items we were informed after waiting in the queue that there were none left.

When I say informed the colleague barked at us that there was none left.This is the kind of attitude I'd expect off a 5 year old and not the 40 odd year old serving us.

The woman at the til wasn't much better in attitude when we were trying to pay for drinks.

It's evident customer service in your caf√© in Glasgow isn't required to work here.Wont be rushing back."
"I am still in shock with the level of service, or should I say the lack of service

3.30 on a Monday afternoon, not busy at all there must have been 10 staff members on the floor but despite this the service was appaling 

15 min wait to order drinks, and then another 20 mins after finishing our meal before plates were cleared, I had to ask for the bill, even table opposite us were complaining as they hadn't been served and another 15 min had passed 

In a time when businesses are really struggling, you would think customer service would be a priority, but not in here not even as much as a thank you from the girl at the door as we were leaving 

I'm sorry to leave such a bad review, but that kind of service is just not acceptable "
Mehul was very attentive and observant. Brilliant service. Meals very tasty with generous portions for all 5 of us. Will be back.
My two girls and I had a great time at TGI's. It is their favourite restaurant. Chris was very attentive. Nothing was a bother. We will be back again soon. Thank you!
"Came in for lunch with my two sons, this is one of our favourite restaurants! Always guaranteed of great food and service, especially from Kyle M."
"Family Sunday dinner, and mixed feelings. The food was ok, but have to say the prices were too expensive for what we had. Simple starters of mozzarella sticks were nearly ¬£10 for 4 small sticks... Burgers really pricey
 Dessert was a let down. Did not have the first 2 choices, settled for a sundae, but once again at just under a tenner, too expensive. 
Service was a bit slow, and manager took part of the order due to allergies, and she was rather abrupt. Didn't fill us with confidence that our needs would be met.

Also when serving drinks, some was spilled on my burger, the waiter gave a quick flippant apology, I should have asked for a replacement burger as the bum was soaked.

Won't be rushing back."
"This is a fantastic place for a night out, attentive staff and incredible food! 

Waheed was our server, awesome guy 

Steaks are next level."
We chose this restaurant as it was close to hotel and we are couldn‚Äôt be happier with the fabulous service as soon as walked through the door and our lovely waiter Waheed who was very attentive and very friendly. Made a nice change to get such a lovely waiter who took time to speak. Then the food was first class the steak was cooked to perfection and the cocktails were amazing too. Thanks again Shannon & Clare üòä
An absolutely amazing meal made even more enjoyable by the fantastic service provided by Waheed. His attention was second to none and enhanced the experience. Can definitely recommend this as the place to eat
Food was very good and our waiter Waheed was very friendly and nothing was ever too much! Will defo be back thanks Waheed! :)
"Have been to the restaurant a trio of times and always a good experience. Waheed and Cassie are both excellent, super helpful and genuinely good at what they do. I hope they are being paid enough as they are the reason we come back!

Have had the Ultimate Roast which includes chicken, beef and lamb in the one dish, the Butcher‚Äôs Bangers Block is very tasty and the Rump Steak is pretty decent too. 

Would definitely recommend the restaurant for lunch or dinner, it‚Äôs never too busy even at the weekend and the booths are a nice place to dine."
"So we visit Glasgow regularly every 6 weeks from Liverpool, and we always try and find new places to eat when we visit. The curry cottage was this visit hit.
Sitting just one or 2 minutes from Sauchiehall Street, what I think may be Glasgows china town district, sat this little family run restaurant. Small menu, but all the choices you would need from Karahi to tikas to Naga.
We had chicken pepper pakoras and hagis pakoras which were dee lish followed by Keema Aloo which is lamb mince potatoes and spinach which is in an extremely tasty aromatic curry sauce and a Butter chicken which was so so tasty accompanied with Pilau rice and 2 Roti breads. The service was very personalised by the chef üë®‚Äçüç≥ and lovely lady. Great prices too, considering the quality of meals service and cleanliness of this little Glasgow gem.
All in all, I highly recommend a visit .
"
"Brilliant Indian restaurant. Authentic!
Superb tasty food (especially the lamb karahi dish).
I‚Äôve actually known the chef for a good number of years as he worked in another restaurant and at his period of working there it was a very popular place and my ‚Äògo to‚Äô for Indian food.
He now owns and cooks in The Curry Corner in Glasgow and I would wholeheartedly recommend anyone to pay it a visit. Moderate prices and very friendly and experienced staff.
What‚Äôs not to like!!!!
Enjoy."
What a brilliant little curry house. Freshly prepared poppadoms with great pickles. Two of the best lamb currys we have ever eaten. Friendly service and a very reasonable price.
"Our starters (chicken pepper fry & ginger fish pakora) and mains (lamb karahi, king prawn curry) were perhaps the best Indian dishes we‚Äôve had and we were looking forward to our dessert to finish off what had been an excellent meal. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. We both had gulab jamun with ice cream - one tiny doughnut tasting of nothing in particular with 2 scoops of bland ice cream - what a let down. Service was efficient and friendly, beer was ok but next time we won‚Äôt bother with the dessert"
"very nice, attentive staff and delicious food! the garlic & cheese naan was so good and one of the best curries ! üòã nice atmosphere, definitely will be back!"
"Great lunch & cocktails at Saint Jude‚Äôs, staff were so attentive and friendly from the moment we walked in. Will definitely be back."
Horrible experience. The gm Chris looked my whole family up and down and treated us like we were beneath him the whole time. Food was late and cold. My nans worst birthday ever and probably her last‚Ä¶.
"Absolutely appalling experience, food was cold, the drinks tasted watered down and the gm chris I think his name was, was rude and unprofessional at best! As soon as I arrived he gave me us a dirty look. Made me and my family's experience awful and totally regret going to the other well recommended venues in the area. 100% won't be back and can't believe that the management are in the position they are in. AVOID!"
Kids Kareoke package.  My daughter celebrated her 10th birthday in condo suite . Scott and the staff looked after us really well. The mocktails were amazing. Would recommend.
"At saint judes for a birthday. Great staff and great service. Louis and Glen especially went the extra mile to make the night enjoyable. Friendly, approachable and generally a good bloke. Thoroughly recommend and ask for Louis for some surreal chat."
